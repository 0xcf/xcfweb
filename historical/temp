		    <p><strong>Today, the XCF is in the process of being re-born</strong>.
		      Fortunately, computer hardware is now much more readily available than when the
		      XCF was originally founded, and the sheer number of advances that have occurred
		      due to the explosion of the Internet since the heyday of the organization, have
		      rendered an unparalleled and unique opportunity to pursue once again the kind of
		      visionary software engineering the XCF of old was renowned for.</p>

		    <p>While we re-tool and rebuild our infrastructure, the XCF is co-sponsoring a
		      <a href="https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu">DeCal</a> on UNIX Systems Administration
		      along with the <a href="https://ocf.berkeley.edu">Open Computing Facility</a>.</p>

		    <p>For more information on the current status of the XCF, please send an email to
		      info at xcf dot berkeley dot edu, or drop by the OCF Lab in 171 MLK, where most XCF
		      members can usually be found.</p>
