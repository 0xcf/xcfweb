<TT>make</TT> is a language used to express dependencies (via rules) and
update methods (via shell).  If one writes make rules which do not
take advantage of additions made to specific implementations of the make
interpreter, the dependency rules expressed in the <I>Makefile</I> will be
portable across all platforms and all interpreters.  This makes <TT>make</TT>
quite powerful.
<P>
Note that the update methods, which are expressed in shell, are not entirely
portable when we consider deviant platforms such as Windows NT.  To that
end, we'll go over some practices which can make porting Makefiles a bit
easier later on.
<P>

<P>
<H1>make and dependency graphs</H1>
<P>
The really big picture is that <TT>make</TT> is a language in which we
can express dependencies via a set of <I>dependency rules</I>.  These
dependency rules are then used to build a dependency graph.  (If you
distill the vocabulary a bit, you can see that the rules are really
adjacency lists and that the dependency graph is no more than a
run-of-the-mill directed graph.)  Given the graph, <TT>make</TT> traverses
the subgraph whose root is specified on the command line depth first.
For example,
<P>
<PRE>% make subgraph1</PRE>
<P>
If a dependency root is not specified then <TT>make</TT> traverses the
subgraph whose root is the first rule in the Makefile.
<P>
That's all fine, but without a rule to use to evaluate dependencies, the
dependencies have no meaning.  <TT>make</TT>'s rule is to evaluate
dependencies based on time.  <B>If any descendents of a node are younger than
the node itself then the node is out of date and must be updated.</B>
<P>
If you are using <TT>make</TT> to help maintain a program, this means that
a program module is out of date if any of its constituent modules are newer
than the module itself.  We will see an example of this shortly.
<P>
<H1>Basic rule construction</H1>
<P>
Syntactically correct make rules will look like this:
<P>
<UL><I>targets</I> ...: <I>dependencies ...</I><BR>
<UL><I>update method</I></UL><BR>
<B>Figure 1: Make rule syntax</B></UL>
<P>
Please note that <TT>make</TT> pays close attention to those tokens which
we usually take for granted in our no-longer-punched-card world such as
newlines and tabs.  If you get too creative with the formatting
of your Makefile, <TT>make</TT> will mysteriously cease to do the expected!
Knowing that, let's analyze the <TT>make</TT> rule constituents:
<P>
The first line of a make rule consists of a list of targets, a colon, a list
of dependencies, and is terminated with a newline.
<P>
<UL>
<TABLE border=1><TR valign=top><TD>targets ...</TD>
<TD>The targets are dependent upon the dependencies.  Quite often, we will
see only one target followed by a long list of dependencies.</TD>
<TD>REQUIRED</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD>dependencies ...</TD>
<TD>The dependencies should be viewed as components of the targets.</TD>
<TD>optional</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD>update method</TD>
<TD>The update method is a shell script, <B>OFFSET BY A TAB</B>, which
contains the commands necessary to update the target if the target is found
to be out of date.</TD>
<TD>optional</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Figure 2: Make rule syntax elements</B></UL>
<P>
If you don't know what's going on yet, don't stress!  I'm about to explain
what's going on.  But first, let's see a simple real-world example.
<P>
<UL>
<TABLE border=1><TR><TH>Rule #</TH><TH>Rule</TH><TH>English</TH></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD>1</TD>
<TD><PRE>program: main.o
	$(CC) $@ $(LDFLAGS) $^</PRE></TD>
<TD><I>program</I> depends on <I>main.o</I>.  When <I>main.o</I> is up to date,
use the statement <PRE>$(CC) $@ $(LDFLAGS) $^</PRE> to bring <I>program</I>
up to date.</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD valign=top>2</TD>
<TD><PRE>main.o: main.c main.h
	$(CC) -c $@ $^</PRE></TD>
<TD><I>main.o</I> depends on <I>main.c</I> and <I>main.h</I></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<B>Figure 3: Simple Makefile</B></UL>
<P>
The simple Makefile in Figure 3 is a small example of how all Makefiles look
and work.  Let's explain the rules which were used in Figure 3.
<P>
Rule 1 is special for a number of reasons.  First, it is the first rule.
That is important because the first rule is the default rule.  More on that
later.  Second, Rule 1 is the link rule, where we take a bunch of .o files
and smash them into one executable binary.  That means that we need to write
a special update method for the rule which contains the commands necessary to
build <I>program</I> from its constituent object files, namely <I>main.o</I>.
We accomplish this using an amalgam of obscure syntax and variables.  We
do that because we want to make it impossible for other people to decipher
how to compile our programs.
<P>
Rule 2 is a typical <TT>make</TT> rule.  It says that &quot;If either
<I>main.c</I> or <I>main.h</I> is newer than <I>main.o</I> then <I>main.o</I>
is out of date.  Update <I>main.o</I> by executing <I>$(CC) -c $@ $^</I>&quot;.
<P>
<H1>Variables</H1>
<P>
<TT>make</TT> variables are often a sore point, but they need not be.  True,
their syntax is abhorrent and it is impossible to remember what the
single-character variables mean, but they really are pretty useful.
<P>
There are a couple of things to keep in mind.  First, all exported shell
environment variables are accessible in <TT>make</TT>.  Second, most
<TT>make</TT> variables must be referenced using <I>$(variable)</I> instead
of the typical $variable which we use in shell.  Sometimes you will see
${variable} used, but I think it's sort of ugly.
<P>
Single-character variables are special.  In Figure 3, we saw <I>$@</I> and
<I>$^</I>.  $@ refers to the rule target and $^ refers to the rule's first
dependency.  $&lt; which we will talk about later, refers to all depedencies.
There are others, of course, but we won't talk about them here.
<P>
If an update method needs to refer to a shell variable, such as in the
following contrived example (Figure 4), then the $ must be escaped with a
$, making the variable reference look like this: <I>$$variable</I>.
<P>
<UL><PRE>target: dependency
	# When we update this target we need to mail a bunch of people
	# about it.
	for i in jim chuck joe; do \
	   echo "$@ updated" | mail $$i -s "$@ updated"; \
	done</PRE><BR>
<B>Figure 4: Using shell variables in update methods.</B>  Note the use of
$$ to refer to the shell variable i.</UL>
<P>
<H1>A useful example</H1>
<P>
The following is an example of a Makefile which you might see in the small
projects typical of undergraduate computer science courses.
<P>
<UL><PRE>LIBDIR = .
LDFLAGS = -L$(LIBDIR) -lcommonlib
CC = /usr/local/bin/gcc
CFLAGS = -c -g -Wall

project: module1 module2

module1: server server_test

server: server.o commonlib
	$(CC) $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS)

server_test: server_test.o server
	$(CC) $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS)

module2: client

client: parser.o lexer.o interface.o commonlib
	$(CC) $@ $(<:commonlib=) $(LDFLAGS)

commonlib: libcommonlib.a

libcommonlib.a(textio.o): textio.h

clean:
	rm -f *.a *.o</PRE><BR>
<B>Figure 5: A useful example</B></UL>
<P>
<H2>Rules worth mentioning in Figure 5</H2>
<P>
There are only a couple of rules worth talking about in Figure 5.
<P>
<H3>The first</H3>
<P>
The first is the <I>client</I> rule.  It builds a binary named
<I>client</I> out of three object files and a library dependency.
The funny syntax, <I>$(&lt;:commonlib=)</I> is a substitution.
It takes care of some conflicting needs.
<P>
Normally, we would have used the <I>$^</I> automatic variable to build
a binary using its associated object file.  Unfortunately that only works
with absurdly small projects consisting of but one object file.  Here, we
need to find some syntax which allows us to tell <TT>make</TT> that
<I>client</I> depends not only on its object files but also on a library
module, which we have represented as a (non-terminal) dependency.  So
we do that on the first line.  Our dependencies are all set up.
<P>
Now comes the tricky part.  We need to somehow write an update method which
will link <I>client</I> with the first three listed dependencies, namely
<I>client</I>'s object files, but exclude the last dependency: the library.
(We want to exclude the library because presumably we have stuck the
-lcommmonlib in the LDFLAGS variable.  This, among other reasons.)  So
we'll use some <TT>make</TT> syntax to get us out of the jam.
<P>
Let's pick apart <I>$(&lt;:commonlib=)</I>.  First, the <I>$()</I> notation
should be familiar.  We're referencing a variable.  Second, the <I>&lt;</I>
is the variable we are referencing, namely the &quot;all dependencies&quot;
variable.  Finally, we're left with <I>:commonlib=</I>.  That is a string
substitution.  It means, &quot;While expanding this variable, replace all
occurences of the sequence of characters <I>commonlib</I> with the empty
sequence of characters.&quot;  So we've successfully done away with the
library issue.
<P>
As usual, there were other ways to skin this cat.  We could have used a
shell escape and filtered <I>commonlib</I> away with sed, awk, perl, or
your favorite shell tool.  We could have used a <TT>make</TT>
subsequence operator...if our version of <TT>make</TT> supports such things.
There are certainly other ways too.
<P>
<H3>The second</H3>
<P>
The second rule I'd like to point out is the funny looking one:
<I>libcommonlib.a(textio.o): textio.h</I>.  This is
<B>THE MOST USEFUL THING YOU CAN LEARN AS A BUILD ENGINEER</B>.  I've
seen it screwed up in many places, causing lots of frustration to the
Makefile users.
<P>
The parenthetical notation means that inside the archive
<I>libcommonlib.a</I> is a file <I>textio.o</I>.  That archive member
depends on <I>textio.h</I>.  Therefore, when <I>textio.h</I>, the
archive member must be updated.
<P>
You might think this is pretty uncessary, because we could have done away
with the whole problem using rules similar to the following:
<P>
<UL><PRE>textio.o: textio.h
	$(CC) -c $@ $^

libcommonlib.a: textio.o</PRE><BR>
<B>Figure 6: Rules to update a library.</B></UL>
<P>
Actually, that is probably correct.  Not quite as tidy as what we saw in
Figure 5, but this is probably okay to do.  I don't know, I never do it
that way.  Usually when I get lazy, I do it the wrong way, which we'll
see in Figure 7.
<P>
<UL><PRE>textio.o: textio.h
	$(CC) -c $@ $^; \
	$(AR) rcv libcommonlib.a $@</PRE><BR>
<B>Figure 7: The wrong rule to update a library.</B></UL>
<P>
This is wrong because the transaction of building the object file and
updating its container library is not preserved.  If a user were to hit
^C between the compile and archive lines in the update method specified in
Figure 7, then the object file would be up to date while the archive would
be out of date.  The archive, however, would never be updated, because there
is no rule which targets the library.
<P>
<H1>Update method hints</H1>
<P>
In general, there are a few hints which should be observed regarding
update methods, particularly when they are written in shell.  <TT>make</TT>
is very specific and a bit wierd in the way it processes update methods.
<P>
Each line of an update method is executed in a new shell unless the newline
is escaped with a backslash.  This is important to note for performance
reasons as well as parallelization.  To demonstrate:
<P>
<UL><PRE>target: object.o
	$(CC) $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS)
	echo Finished $@.</PRE><BR>
<B>Figure 8: Improper update method.</B></UL>
<P>
In Figure 8, both lines of the update method would be executed in
separate shells.  This is admitedly a trivial example, but the differences
would become apparent immediately if any shell scripting were done in
earnest as part of an update method.
<P>
<UL><PRE>target: object.o
	$(CC) $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS); echo Finished $@.</PRE>
<P>
The following is also acceptable:
<P>
<PRE>target: object.o
	$(CC) $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS); \
	echo Finished $@.</PRE><BR>
<B>Figure 9: Correct update methods.</B></UL>
<P>
Improper update methods will lead to funny, non-deterministic errors if
<TT>make</TT> is ever used to run parellel build jobs.  It is pretty tough
to write a parallelizable Makefile correctly, but painstaking attention to
the little details of backslashifying newlines can save a lot of trouble.
<P>
<H1>Things of note that we haven't covered</H1>
<P>
There are many useful <TT>make</TT> operators which we have not talked about.
Among them are string manipulation functions, subsequence operators, etc.
There is some useful subshell syntax which is worth looking at, in the
form of $(shell ...).
<P>
Many of the <TT>make</TT> variables, automatic and otherwise, have been
left out in our cursory discussion.  <I>MAKEFLAGS</I> is a particularly useful
one.
<P>
Most important, however, we have skipped the entire discussion of implicit
rules, their formulation, specification, and utilization.  Implicit rules
can be your friends when used properly, or your most confounding enemies
when used improperly.
