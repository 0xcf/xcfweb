This page describes some non-trivial usage of the C programming langauge.
Covered topics include: standard idioms, preprocessor macros, unexpected
syntax constructs.  While not all the code presented can be considered 
an example of a good
software engineering practice, stretching the boundaries of C
will lead to better understanding of the language.  Other benefit of
learning these tricks include potential to make a better impression
on a prospective employer (some of the problems reviewed were known to
be a basis for a question at technical interview).

Prerequisites: basic knowledge of C; access to a

<h3>
Calculating length of an array
</h3>
Ever wondered why C does not have a built-in operator to get the number
of elements
in an array?  That's because such functionality can be easily implemented by
a programmer in a one-line macro:
<pre>
/* Returns the number of elements in the array */
#define NumElm(array) (sizeof (array) / sizeof ((array)[0]))
</pre>
This macro computes the number of elements in an array by dividing the total
size of an array by the size of a single element.  The most important point
to note is that this calculation is done at <b>compile time</b>; this
not only makes the use of this macro as efficient at run-time as replacing
the macro call with a constant, but also allows the use of the macro call
in a context where constant expressions are required, so you can write something
like this:
<pre>
int a[10];
int b[NumElm(a)];	/* equivalent to <i>int b[10];</i> */
</pre>
This is a standard way to calculate array length in C; it is described in
K&R.
<p>
Note that this works only with "real" arrays; the result of this macro when
given a pointer as an argument is meaningless (there is no general way
to get a number of objects pointed to by a pointer -- pointers to objects and
pointers to arrays of objects are the same thing in C.  That's a feature.)
<a name="define"><hr></a>
<h3>
More on preprocessor macros
</h3>
C preprocessor macros can be used with great benefits; but you have to know
how to write them, or you can run into unexpected problems.  For example,
let's look at the following innocent-looking <tt>#define</tt>:
<pre>
/* WRONG! */
#define SQUARE(x)   x * x
</pre>
Does it work?  Most of the time.  But when someone (not necessarily the
author of the macro) attempts to calculate <tt>SQUARE(3 - 1)</tt>, he or
she gets <tt>-1</tt>.  Surprising, isn't it?
The problem is especially
hard to trace if the macro call is hidden in a large expression.
<p>
These problems arise because C macros are expanded at the preprocessor
level, and all syntax and semantic analysis is done <b>after</b> this
stage.  Preproccesor simply
replaces <tt>SQUARE(3 - 1)</tt> with
<tt>3 - 1 * 3 - 1</tt>, which is, of course, parsed as <tt>3 - (1*3) - 1</tt>
and evaluated to <tt>-1</tt>.  This bug can be fixed by puting parentheses
around all references to arguments in a macro definition; but that still
leaves some problems unsolved.  Let's look at a bit different macro:
<pre>
/* STILL WRONG! */
#define DOUBLE(x)   (x) + (x)
</pre>
Again, this works sometimes and misteriously gives incorrect results in other
expressions.  For example, <tt>DOUBLE(2)*10</tt> gives an unexpected result,
because precedence of multiplication is higher than that of addition.  This
can be fixed by enclosing the macro body in parentheses:
<pre>
/* Sort of right, but see below.. */
#define DOUBLE(x)   ((x) + (x))
</pre>
This is the best we can do as far as preprocessor macros go.  But there are
still pitfalls: <tt>x</tt> is evaluated twice, so if an argument to a macro
has any side effects
(for example, <tt>++</tt> or <tt>--</tt>, or a call to a function), then 
again the Wrong Things will happen.  This can't be avoided, and therefore
this behaviour is officially declared a Feature.  BTW, the convention
to use upper case letters for macro names is a good thing because
it alerts the programmer to potential problems.
<p>
Morale: write macros defensively, puting parentheses around arguments and
macro body; do not pass expressions with side effects to macros; use
alternatives (such as inline functions) whenever possible.

<h3>
Why some people love C, and others hate it
</h3>
<pre>
/* It compiles without a warning.  <i>Really.</i>  Try it. */
int x[10]; 5[x] = 42;
</pre>
Disclaimer: do not use this expression in production code -
I will not pay your unemployment benefits.  <b>Don't say I didn't warn you.</b>
<p>
This example demonstartes an interesting point.  The subscript operator,
<tt>x[y]</tt>, is really symmetric, despite the asymmetric notation.  Really,
<tt>x[y]</tt> is exactly the same as <tt>*(x+y)</tt> which is of course
the same as <tt>*(y+x)</tt> which is equivalent to <tt>y[x]</tt>.
So, <tt>x[y]</tt> is equivalent to <tt>y[x]</tt>. QED.
<p>
Depending on your point of view, this can be either cute or disgusting.
<a name="notnot"><hr></a>
<h3>
<tt>2 B || ! 2 B</tt>
</h3>
<pre>
/* equivalent to (x ? 1 : 0) */
int y = !!x;
</pre>
Another one of the "don't try this at home" C syntax hacks.  Evaluates to
<tt>1</tt> if <tt>x</tt> is non-zero; evaluates to <tt>0</tt> if
<tt>x</tt> is <tt>0</tt>.  This example
llustrates the difference between <tt>~</tt>
(bitwise NOT) and <tt>!</tt> (logical NOT).  While <tt>~~x</tt> is <tt>x</tt>,
the result of <tt>!</tt> is <tt>1</tt> or <tt>0</tt>; so double application
of <tt>!</tt> "maps" all non-zero numbers to <tt>1</tt>.  For example,
in the following expression
<pre>
int count = !!x + !!y + !!z;
</pre>
<tt>count</tt> is assigned the number of non-zero variables in {x, y, z}.
<p>
Surgeon general's warning: using this syntax can be bad for your health.
BTW, <tt>x</tt> can sometimes be a pointer, too.

<a name="ptr2fn"><hr></a>
<h3>
Pointers to functions
</h3>
In C, pointers to functions are not used as much as they could be used.
I am convinced that the primary reason for this is that nobody remembers
the syntax for the declaration.  The solution is simple: just look up
an example in any decent book or self-respecting header file.
After a couple of years -- you have memorized it!
<p>
For your convinience,
I'll include an example here.  If you have a function that takes an integer
and returns a pointer, such as 
<pre>
char * foo (int);
</pre>
then defining a corresponding function pointer type is easy -- just
replace function name with <tt>(*varname)</tt>:
<pre>
char * (*fooptr) (int) = foo;
</pre>
Note that parentheses are <b>required</b>; otherwise, instead of a
declaration of a pointer to a function that returns a pointer you will
get a declaration of a function that returns a pointer to a pointer, which
is obviously not what you intended.
<p>
It is often handy to a define a function pointer type.  This is done by
puting <tt>typedef</tt> in front of the declaration the and substituting
type name for variable name:
<pre>
typedef char * (*footype) (int);
</pre>
You can you use your type to declare variables, but not functions:
<pre>
footype baz = foo; /* Ok */
foo this_doesnt_work { return (NULL); } /* Can't do that */
</pre>
You can use function pointers to do many interesting things, some more
acceptable in production code than others.  Example of the latter: you
can shorten the notation of
<pre>
if (z) then x(a, b); else y(a, b);
</pre>
not only to
<pre>
z ? x(a, b) : y(a, b);
</pre>
but further to
<pre>
(z ? x : y) (a, b);
</pre>
<a name="qsort"><hr></a>
<h3>
Sorting strings with <tt>qsort()</tt>
</h3>
On a more practical note, a C programmer usually encounters function
pointers for the first time when dealing with the <tt>qsort()</tt>
function.  Often, the problem is to sort strings;
<pre>
const char **base;
int nel;
qsort(base, nel, sizeof (char *), strcmp) /* Wrong! */
</pre>
seems like a perfect candidate for the job, and it usually compiles;
but it doesn't work as expected!
Figuring out why it doesn't work leads to better
understanding of pointers and is a good investment of time;
I will not include a complete explanation here
and will just provide the correct solution:
<pre>
/* of course this function can be written in one line... */
int strptrcmp (void *p1, void *p2)
{
    const char *s1 = *((const char **) p1);
    const char *s2 = *((const char **) p1);

    return (strcmp (s1, s2));
}

/* ... */
const char **base;
int nel;
qsort(base, nel, sizeof (char *), strptrcmp);
</pre>
<a name="global"><hr></a>
<h3>
Avoiding duplicate declarations
</h3>
Now here is a neat preprocessor trick.  It is similar in style
to the standard way of forcing header files to be included only once.
Almost every header file looks like this:
<pre>
#ifndef _SOMEHEADER_H_
#define _SOMEHEADER_H_

/* Header file body... */

#endif /* ! _SOMEHEADER_H_ */
</pre>
This <tt>#ifdef</tt>'s out the body of the header file on second and
subsequent includes; this avoids duplicate declarations and potential
infinite recursion in inclusion.  Smart compilers (such as <tt>gcc</tt>)
don't even open the file the second time it's referenced.
<p>
Here's how to use preprocessor to avoid declaring global variables two
times (one, as <tt>extern</tt>, in header file, and one in <tt>.c</tt> file).
In your header file, use the following code:
<pre>
#ifdef I_AM_MAIN
#define GLOBAL /*nothing*/
#else
#define GLOBAL extern
#endif

/* Global variables declared below... */
GLOBAL int foo;
GLOBAL char *bar;
/* etc. */
</pre>
Just include the header file as usual; all the <tt>GLOBAL</tt> declarations
will be converted to <tt>extern</tt>.  And in exactly one source file
(usually the main file of the project), insert the line
<pre>
#define I_AM_MAIN
</pre>
<b>before</b> including the header file.  As a result, the variables will
be declared without <tt>extern</tt>, and storage will be allocated for
them.  This trick avoids duplicate declarations and helps keep variable
declarations in sync (just think of the consequences of declaring
a <tt>char x[];</tt> in one file as <tt>extern char *x</tt> in
another...)  It is trivial to write a macro to handle initializations
of global variables declared in this way.
<p>
Oh, and one more thing: <b>don't</b> call global variables <tt>foo</tt> or
<tt>bar</tt>.
