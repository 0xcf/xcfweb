<H2>XCF | Purpose</H2>

<HR>

<P>
XCF is a primarily undergraduate computing society supporting and
organizing highly motivated students interested in working on
extra-curricular projects.  We provide students with a lab, computers,
hand tools, and most importantly, other XCF members.
<P>
<H3>Members are our most valuable asset</H3>
Our most valuable asset is our members.  By promoting, attacking, defending,
and otherwise evaluating one another's ideas, we foster an engineering
atmosphere which develops and develops an intimate understanding of software
systems and their engineering.
<P>
<H3>XCF members are devoted</H3>
XCF members are devoted to the development of their already-vast computing
knowledge and the promotion of XCF as an organization.  We want XCF to
continue to attract bright new members while increasing XCF's value to the
computing community at large.
<P>
<H3>Resources we provide to our members</H4>
As a non-ASUC sponsored organization, we rely on our members, the Computer
Science Division, and corporate sponsorship to maintain and improve our
computing resources.
