<H2 ALIGN=center>Proposed Memorandum of Understanding between the XCF and the CS Division</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The purpose of this memo is to record the relationship between UC
Berkeley's <B>Experimental Computing Facility</B>
(<A HREF="../../../index.html">XCF</A>) and the <B>UC Berkeley Computer
Science Division</B> (<A HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/">CS</A>).

<P>

The XCF is a primarily student organization recognized by the Computer
Science division. The XCF provides computing resources and an appropriate
environment to individuals who undertake programming (or other computer
science related) projects of moderate size as well as consulting to the
users of the CS computing facilities. In addition, the XCF serves as a
contact point between undergraduates and the CS faculty and staff to
coordinate undergraduate efforts in these projects.

<P>

To facilitate general communication and cooperation between the XCF and CS,
the XCF director works with a CS faculty advisor. The XCF director is an
elected member of the organization, while the advisor is preferably the CNR
Committee chair.

<P>

While members may join the XCF via the original proposal process, the
XCF extends membership to those who choose to work on projects for the
faculty or staff of the CS division. Faculty may take advantage of the
XCFs participation by mailing project descriptions to the XCF, who
will then make them available on their information server. The XCF
will act as a "clearinghouse" for student projects, in some cases
matching projects with suitably prepared students. Once a student
undertakes a project, the faculty sponsor reviews the student's
progress on a semesterly basis and decides whether to continue
sponsorship. The student may also enroll in the "Supervised
Independent Study" course (CS199). Grades for CS199 should be based on
satisfactory progress on the project.
