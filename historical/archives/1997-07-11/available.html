<tr>
<td>Drawing Program</td>
<td>Pete's GTK is a very nice toolkit, one which could probably
replace the horrible interface of xfig without too much difficulty.
This project could get you a reasonable ammount of internet-freeware
fame.  I (Josh) have looked at the code and evaluated the difficulty,
it doesn't look too hard.  To really rule, you'd add a few missing
features.  You would not be just porting to GTK, the interface sorely
needs a redesign.  Contact <a href="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">
Josh</a> for more info.
<tr>
<td>Project Manager</td>
<td>Think Technologies Think C (subsequently know as Symantec Think
C) had a very user friendly project system which behaved very much like
UNIX's make. This was such a good idea that VC++ supports projects. It would
be neat to implement an interface to make, makedepend, gcc -M, CVS (or
better yet, PRCS), autoconf, and package all of this in a graphical project
manager.  This would allow the user to easily add new source files and
libraries to his project, easily perform checkins and checkouts, and
facilitate packing. 
An interface to emacs is crucial to the acceptance of this package. Mail
<a href="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">ali</a> for more info.
Also contact <a href="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">josh</a> because he knows
the GNU software maintenence tools pretty well, and has some ideas
about features the GNU utilities lack in Solaris' make.

<TD>Extensible Web Crawler</TD>
<TD>An extensible web crawler would provide a basic architecture
for crawling the web.  It could be implemented as a C library, allowing
extensions in C/C++, or it could have an embedded Tcl or Perl
interpreter, allowing people to write a web crawler in a common
scripting language.  This project would be useful anytime you are
doing an in depth search for information on the web.  Heuristics
could be developed to order documents by importance.

description.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Mime Type Resource Server</TD>
<TD>This would be a server that archived information based on its
mime type.  The general idea is that the server provides a well
maintained, read-only archive of data, searchable by mime type.
An example application would be a network enabled drawing program
that could connect to the resource server and allow the drawing
program user to browse available clip art.  This moves the clip
art archive maintenance to a central location, which is likely
to improve the quality and organization of the information.

<TR>
<TD>Mbone Juke Box</TD>
<TD>An internet jukebox which allows people on the net to make their CD-ROM
players available to the world, registering CD titles on the Mbone, and
allowing users from the net at large to vote on which song title should be
played from the the pool of disks. Mail

<TD>Standard easy X-interface and start-up configuration
<TD>
<ul>
<LI>design an easy window manager/w.m. config file for beginning users</LI>
<LI>design a suntools look-alike window manager and start-up script</LI>
<LI>write a suntools compatibility library</LI>
<LI>set up reasonable default X-resources files
(which will serve also as a template)</LI>
</UL>

<TD>A Music Notation System for X</TD>
<TD>This project would provide software for the  production
of  music  scores.   One  would be able to use a workstation
running X to draft scores  by  hand,  utilizing  an  object-
oriented  graphical interface. This interface would probably
be similar to "MacPaint", "idraw", etc.  Alternatively,  one
could  load  in  Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
data and get it displayed, with  various  options  for  note
quantization,  suppression  of  dynamic markings, etc. Then,
one could modify this data graphically for display on terminal or
printer (probably in PostScript form), or retranslation into MIDI
data.

<TR>
<TD>A Control and Data Flowcharter for C Source Files</TD>
<TD>The goal of this project is to provide an application
which will make clear the data and control flows of C source
files. A clear, extendable protocol for producing  graphical
and typographical output will be developed and used.

<TR>
<TD>Melvyl/Gladis client</TD>
<TD>Provide a system to query the Melvyl and Gladis databases,
including creating reference lists for later hard-copy printout
or save to a regular file.  This would be a more efficient
tool than the current "telnet gladis" interface.
An HTML interface sounds like a good idea.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>SADT tools</TD>
<TD>"SADT" stands for Structured Analysis and Design Technique,
a system of graphically outlining a plan, or more specifically
a program.  There are several books on structured analysis,
and IEEE Computer or Spectrum had an issue on this a year or two
back.  It's the next step beyond flowcharts.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Help and documentation database</TD>
<TD>Design a database for holding documentation of all depths on any
and all programs.  Design an 'oracle' to browse through this database,
include a facility for message passing to/from other programs and for
indexing and cross-referencing.
The objective is for a help service to hold documentation, not
individual programs -- this allows cross referencing.
This could be rolled up into a Web Publication/Documentation System.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Spreadsheet program (for X)</TD>
<TD>Something lacking in the UNIX public domain realm.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Foreign language/multiple font terminal</TD>
<TD>For use by, e.g., a Webster Database viewer, or
for people interested in using French, German, or even
Chinese/Japanese, etc..  This supposedly exists for Japanese ("Jterm").</TD>

<TD>X Control Panel</TD>
<TD>Ala MacIntosh, and for modifying your resource database.
    HP Vue has something similar.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Visual Profilers</TD>
<TD>Both run-time and memory. A freeware copy of purify.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Network Databases</TD>
<TD>Distributed Databases, A better alternative to yp/the
nameserver -- security considerations.
This project has many potential problems and needs more
background than can be given here.
[See "dap".  In fact, a project in itself would be to finish
the dap protocol spec.  --Phil]</TD>

<TD>Enhance the current calculator programs</TD>
<TD>Programmable, storage, check-book balancing, neat graphical user interface?
This would be extremeley useful.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Geometric Data Base Definition and Interface</TD>
<TD>Combine data with locations on a plane or in three dimensions,
and displaying the information in a screen.
First example utility: browser for the periodic table of the elements.
(more utilities should be thought of).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>RPC for Scheme</TD>
<TD> Wouldn't it be neat if you could have remote execution of scheme
functions with parameter passing and the whole works? Contact

<TD>Top 40 simulator (Mike Clancy)</TD>
<TD>I'm looking for someone to write a simulation program that generates a
sequence of top-40 music listings.  Prerequisite background includes
completion of CS 61B or equivalent, plus a statistics course; the latter
is needed to figure out how to model the appearance and disappearance of
songs in each week's top 40.  I expect that 1 unit of CS 199 will be
appropriate for the work required.  For more information, contact me
at <A href="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">clancy@CS.Berkeley.EDU</A>
or 2-7017.</TD>

<TD>Berkeley Logo Interpreter (Brian Harvey)</TD>
<TD>Berkeley Logo is an interpreter for the Logo programming language
that was developed by me and several former Berkeley students; it
is distributed as freeware and widely used around the world.  There
are versions for DOS, Mac, and Unix.
<P>
I'm looking for help in maintaining/developing this program; both
small and large projects are available.  Alas, I have no funds, but
CS 199 credit is possible.  Here are some things on my list:
<UL>
<LI>Fixing bugs!  I have a long list of them.</LI>
<LI>Platform-specific user interface improvements.  Implement things
like cross-program copy and paste, resizing windows with the
mouse, and stuff like that.  (But it's important that the Logo
programs people write remain compatible across platforms.)</LI>
<LI>Platform-independent UI improvements.  A Logo-savvy integrated
editor, for example.</LI>
<LI>Rewrite the core evaluator.  It's gotten pretty messy.</LI>
<LI>Rewrite the entire thing in Java, for easier platform-independence.</LI>
<LI>Write a compiler: either a GCC front end or a compiler to java
bytecode.</LI>
</UL>

Since Logo is a dialect of Lisp, it doesn't have much syntax; things
like LALR parsing aren't going to help much, but understanding garbage
collection will help.  Expertise on PCs or Macs will help for certain
tasks.  The best preparation for working on Berkeley Logo is to
understand the explicit-control evaluator in chapter 5 of Abelson
and Sussman, because that's where we started in writing the Logo
evaluator.  And of course I want people who'll really get the work done
and not flake off!  :-)</TD>
