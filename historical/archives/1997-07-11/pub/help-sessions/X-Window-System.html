1) Intro
 what is X?
	bitmaps
		X Window System consists of a server and one or more client
		programs.  The server controls a bitmap display, and client
		programs send their requests to the display.  These include
		getting input and writing output.
	windows
		Most clients open up a "window", which is their little area
		of workspace in the "root", or main, window.  All other
		windows are descendants of the root window.
	cursor
		The cursor is the pointer device.  It is controlled by the
		mouse.  In order for a window to receive input, the mouse
		must usually be in that window.  This is called "focus".
	xdm (X display manager)
		This program is run (usually when the computer reboots) to
		run X.  It starts up X, accepts logins, and then runs the
		.xsession
	.xsession
		This is a file in your home directory, usually in a shell
		script format.  It is executed by the xdm when it starts up
		your login.  This has all of your defaults and startup
		configuration commands in it, such as the commands to open
		the initial windows, and start up a window manager
	man
		man?  The online manual?  What does that have to do with
		X?  A lot!!!  How can you possibly learn anything about the
		three quadrillion X applications out there without the manual?
		Use man.  man is your friend. "man X" for some neat info.

 the window manager
	general
		The window manager is a special client program, given 
		special responsibilities and powers by X.  It does neat stuff
		like adding titles, resize & iconify buttons, and borders to
		all your windows.  Anything that you input is first caught
		by the window manager, and then acted upon.  (If the cursor is
		in a window, your keystrokes are generally just passed onto
		whatever client is running in that window)
	customizing
		to set your customizations and initial options, the window
		manager looks in your home directory for its dotfile.  For 
		twm (tab window manager), the manager that comes with the
		standard distribution of X, this file is called ".twmrc".  
		There are other window managers available, with different
		dotfiles.  The manpage for twm lists lots of things that
		you can set in your .twmrc.

 mouse
	The different buttons on the mouse do different things, depending
	on when and where the cursor is.  Some general defaults are:
	when in root window
		opens different menus, as specified in your .twmrc 
		1 - window tools
		2 - window manager stuff
		3 - programs
	when in other windows (like xterms)
		1 - highlight (capture) text
		2 - paste text
		3 - extend highlight
		control-1 - xterm specific menus
		control-2 - set options for window, such as scrollback
		control-3 - change font

2) Basics	
 setenv DISPLAY
	Each root window has a display and screen number associated with it.
	Most machines only run one root window (the console window, usually),
	number 0.0.  To access this display over the network (say, from
	uclink to sandstorm), you would need to tell the program on uclink
	to display it on sandstorm.  This is usually accomplished by setting
	an environment variable, DISPLAY.  So, "setenv DISPLAY sandstorm:0.0"
	will tell your uclink application what you want.

 xhost & xauth
	There are various levels of security in X.  How does the server know
	which programs to let in?  There needs to be a way to tell it that
	you don't want it to run programs coming in from some random site like
	stanford or new zealand.  xhost is a good first step here.  xhost
	checks what computer a request is coming from before allowing it 
	access to your display.  It maintains a list of allowed computers.
	Adding a computer to the list is easy: "xhost +<computername>".  Use
	a "-" instead of a "+" to take a computer off the access list.
	"xhost +" and "xhost -" turn off and on, respectively, access control.
	"xhost +" will let any computer access your display. (not generally
	a good thing).  xauth is a more secure version.  It uses a password
	transmitted by the remote client, and checks it against the local
	password, to see if the client is allowed to run.  Check the manual
	for more specific info on xauth.

3) Programs
 standard stuff
	There's a bunch of standard options that almost all x apps will take,
	here are some useful ones:
	-display: you may specify the display (in machine:0.0 type format),
		if you want to override (or don't have) the DISPLAY setting.
	-geometry: specify (hint, actually) the location and size of the
		window.
	-fn: if the program displays text, specify the font to use.  This
		is a really arcane looking name.  Find out what fonts you
		can use by running "xlsfonts | more".
	-T: specify the title of the window in the titlebar and icon. (there
		are several options that do this, each slightly different.
		I use this one)
	-help or -h: A lot of X applications give you a short summary of 
		allowable options

 various useful programs
	xterm
		A program that opens a window and gives you a shell.  Basic
		stuff here: (many options can be preceded by a plus instead
		of a minus to reverse the effect)
			-e - specify a program to run.  This is the last
			argument to xterm on the command line.  It will
			open a window and run the program, closing the window
			when the program finishes execution.  Useful for things
			like rlogin and running side programs.
			-mb - margin bell - ring a bell whenever you type 
			near the right margin
			-sb - enable scrollbar (use -sl to specify number of
			lines to save)
			-vb - visual bell - flash the screen instead of beeping
			-rv - display reverse video
			-iconic - start as an icon instead of a window
	xset
		Set user preferences - usage: "xset <options>"  This program
		has lots of fun options, here's the more useful ones:
			b - bell [volume [pitch [duration]]]
			c - key click (on/off)
			m - mouse [acceleration [threshold]]
			q - query current settings
	xsetroot
		Set root window parameters - usage: "xsetroot <options>"
		Neat stuff to do with the root window:
			-help - help
			-def - restore defaults (if you've messed something up)
			-cursor - change the cursor
			-rv - reverse the fore and back ground colors
		To change the appearance of the background (we call it
		the "wallpaper"):
			-bitmap <filename> - tile given bitmap in background
			-mod <x> <y> - plaid-like pattern (1 to 16)
			-gray (or grey) - make it grey
			-solid <color> - make it whatever color is specified
	xv
		Image Viewer - displays images, like GIFs, PBMs, PGMs, PPMs
		and X11 bitmaps.  A very versatile program (with a slightly
		humorous man page).  Brings up a control box, with which
		you manipulate the image.  You can use it with -root option
		to get a GIF in the root window.
	bitmap
		Remember all those bitmaps?  Well, this is one of the programs
		you can use to create them.  Make bitmaps for cursors,
		wallpaper, icons, whatever.  Format:
			bitmap [-options] filename WIDTHxHEIGHT
		specify a file name, and then give the WIDTH and HEIGHT that
		you want for the bitmap (default is usually 16x16)
			-nodashed - don't print dashed lines in the 
				bitmap window (i.e. - no grid)
	xrdb
		This is the program that modifies the X server's resource
		database.  You use this to load X defaults files.

 favorite other programs
	xclock
		A nice little clock for X.  You can specify -analog or
		-digital, and -chime for whether to beep every half hour
	xload
		Displays a periodically updated histogram of the system
		load average.
	xeyes
		Puts a pair of eyes on your screen that follow the pointer.
		Use the -geometry option with this one for better results.
	xbiff
		Tells you when you get new mail.

	There are many other x apps out there.  Look in whatever directory
	programs like xclock and xterm are in (type "which xclock") to
	see what other programs you can use, and read the man page on them.
