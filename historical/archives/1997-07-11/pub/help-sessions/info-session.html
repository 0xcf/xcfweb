<H2>Overview</H2><br>
<blockquote>
One of the key ideas to a network is the sharing of information.
There are many different ways to distribute and receive all of this 
information on the Internet.  A few "standards" have been established.
One of them is the direct transfer of files from one Internet site to
another: File Transfer Protocol (FTP).  Another consists of a means of 
navigating various menus until the desired information is found: gopher.
More recently, there is a system of documents connected to other documents
via "hyperlinks": World Wide Web (or just the web).  These three protocols
are some of the more popular ways to get information.  There are countless 
others: USENET and WAIS, for starters.  Each of them has two main parts -
someone distributing information and someone getting it.  The distribution
is usually done with a "server" and the getting is done with a "client".
Since we want to talk about Information Retrieval, we'll be explaining how
to use the various "client" programs available.

<p>
<H3>Note</H3><br>
<blockquote>
	In this help sheet, if the instructions say to type "gopher" or
	some other command, you omit the quotes.
</blockquote>
<p>
<H3>Note on terminology</H3><br>
<blockquote>
	A server is a source or repository for services or resources of any
	kind.  A client is a program that access a server and provides the
	resources or services to the user.
</blockquote>
<p>

<H2>FTP</H2><br>
<blockquote>	
File Transfer Protocol (ftp) is a way of directly transfering
files from one computer to another.  It can be used to transfer your
homework from your cs61a account to your OCF account, for instance.  You
simply log on to your OCF account, ftp to your cs61a account, and get the
files you want.  (Simply?  Well, more on that later...)  However, you need
to know both passwords, so your CS Partner couldn't get the part of the 
project you were supposed to do using ftp.  As a matter of fact, no one
but you can get it.  But let's say you have something you want _anyone_
to be able to get.  This is where "anonymous ftp" originated from.  Instead
of logging onto a specific account, you ftp as "anonymous".  People put
things on their Internet computer in a public directory, and anyone who
can ftp to that computer can get their information.
</blockquote>
<p>

<H2>Gopher</H2><br>
<blockquote>
	Gopher is a more visible example of the server-client relationship.
Your gopher client connects to a gopher server.  From there, you connect 
(by selecting items on menus) to various gopher servers, until you find what
you are looking for.  Gopher is different from ftp: you can get files, but
they are usually displayed on your screen (you can save them to your 
account, though).  In addition to that, it can connect you to other sites
with telnet, or ask you a question and search through a database, as well
as several other things.
</blockquote>
<p>

<H2>World Wide Web (WWW or W3)</H2><br>
<blockquote>
	The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible
information, an embodiment of human knowledge. It's organization is an
initiative started at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics located
in Geneva, Switzerland (CERN), and now involves participants. 
<p>
W3 uses hypertext and multimedia techniques to make the web easy for anyone
to roam, browse, and contribute to. Two common programs that are available
for inspecting W3 are Mosaic which is available for the Macintosh, PC
compatible and UNIX environments, and lynx, a text-only client for the UNIX
environment only. Lynx is available on the OCF, instructional machines, and
on the CSUA machines.
<p>
Hypertext is the term for a document that has the capacity for including
elements that make it more than simply text, such as formatting
instructions, images, sounds, movie clips, fields for inputting data, and
most importantly, connections to other documents. This connections, called
links, are what ties the World Wide Web together. These links can connect to
other hypertext documents or other types of documents.
<p>
How does this all work?
<p>
The search and retrieval of information on the WWW is handled by the
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a system of conventions for the request
and delivery of documents. HTTP is WWW's own protocol, a fast and efficient
protocol needed for quick jumps from one document to another.
<p>
There is also a method called the Common Gateway Interface for connecting
other databases and programs to the WWW, allowing for access to a wider
variety of information from many sources.
</blockquote>
<p>

<H2>Internet Computer vs. Your Home Computer</H2><br>
<blockquote>
	Chances are, your computer at home isn't directly on the Internet.
If you dial-up with a modem, and aren't using SLIP or PPP, you aren't.
If you have a mainframe in your house with a direct Ethernet connection, then
you can use FTP, gopher, and www directly.  If you need to log in to a
computer, like the OCF or uclink, you can't ftp files (like games or
pictures, like GIF's and JPEG's) to your Mac, PC, or whatever you have.
You need to "download" them.  This is just a way of transferring information
through your modem onto your disk.  If you don't have a fast modem, but you
have access to a Mac or PC directly connected (like at the Microcomputer
Facilities or at the dorms), you can use those machines to make transfers.
</blockquote>
<p>

<H2>News</H2><br>
<blockquote>
The "Network News Transfer Protocol" (NNTP) allows for the exchange over the
internet of transient news information in the form of articles submitted by
the public (the USENET news format). There are a large variety of subjects
available ranging from recreational to informational. There will be a
separate help session on the USENET and news readers. In general, it is
difficult to obtain in depth expert information on USENET, but it is
possible to engage in conversations with or obtain source references from
other individuals.
</blockquote>
<p>

<H2>FTP</H2><br>
<blockquote>
<H3>Starting ftp</H3><br>
	To start ftp (and do anything useful) you need to know where you're
going to ftp to, like the machine your class account is on, or some public
anonymous ftp server (like rtfm.mit.edu).  The machine you are typing the ftp
command on is called the "local" machine, and the other machine (in this case
danube) is the "remote" machine.  You can then type:<br>
<pre>
	ftp danube.eecs.berkeley.edu	(or whatever machine you want)
</pre><br>
	And it will start your ftp session.  Alternatively, you can just
type "ftp" at the prompt.  It will bring up a "ftp>" prompt, and from there
you can type "open <machine>", where <machine> is the name of the computer.
After a brief message (like a name and time), it will ask for a login.
The default is the login on the local machine.  If you are transferring
files between your own accounts, type the login you use on the remote
machine.  For anonymous ftp, type "anonymous".  If you don't like typing
anonymous (or you keep typing it wrong, like me :) you can sometimes give "ftp"
as your login.  Then it will ask for your password.  If this is your own
account, you need to type the correct password (so that not everyone can
access your files).  For anonymous ftp, you type your login at the local
machine, followed immediately by an at sign (@).  Example:<em>(things I 
typed are in {})</em><p>

<H3>Getting Help</H3><br>

	You can read the man page on ftp: "man ftp" for more information.
You can also type "help" at any ftp> prompt.

<p>
<H3>Directories</H3><br>
Stuff in ftp is organized into directories, just like UNIX. (Most
FTP sites are running UNIX, hence, the directory structure)   You start off
in your home directory.  If you are using anonymous ftp, you usually start
off in a directory like /pub (where the public things are kept).  Then, the
normal directory commands work, except that instead of happening on the
local machine, they happen on the remote machine:<br>
<pre>
	pwd		print the working (current) remote directory
	cd &ltdir&gt	move into the directory named &ltdir&bt
	cd ..		move into the directory before this one
	ls &ltfile&gt	list the files on the remote machine
	dir &ltfile&gt	give long listing
</pre>
<p>
	The ls and dir commands accept wildcards: "?" matches one character,
and "*" matches any number of characters.<p>
	Also, you can move around on the local machine.  (We recommend that
you change into the directory you want to put the ftp stuff into before you
start ftp'ing, but if you didn't... )<br>
<pre>
	lcd &ltdir&gt	change local directory (.. to move up)
	!pwd		print current local directory
	!ls &ltfile&gt	list the files on the local machine
</pre>

<p>
<H3>Getting files</H3><br>

	Once you've gotten to the directory you want to be in, you can
use "get" to bring them to the local machine:<p>
<pre>	get <remote-file> <local-file>
</pre>
<br>	
If you don't specify the local-file, it assumes you want the new
file to be the same.  BE CAREFUL!  If you get a file that you have on both
accounts, you will overwrite the old local version.
<p>
<em>NOTE:</em> If you are downloading games, pictures, or some types of 
compressed files, you need to download them in "binary" mode.  Type 
"bin" to get it.  See the Misc. Neat Stuff section. <p>
	There are also some other things you can do:<br>
<pre>	mget <file1> <file2> <file3> ...
		Gets multiple files.  You can't rename them like with
		get, so be careful here, too.
	get <remote-file> |more
	get <remote-file> |zcat
		If the remote file is a text file, you can display it instead
		of transferring it.  If it is a compressed text file (if
		the name ends with .Z and you're reasonably sure it's text)
		you can uncompress it and view it with zcat.
</pre>

<p>
<H3>Putting files</H3><br>
You can put files from the local machine onto the remote machine
as well.  Use "put" and "mput" instead of "get" and "mget".  This usually
doesn't work with anonymous ftp sites.

<p>
<H3>Quitting</H3><br>
Type quit to quit ftp.  If you want, you can type "close" and
then use "open" to open a different machine.

<p>
<H3>Miscellaneous Neat Stuff</H3>
<pre>
	prompt		normally, ftp will ask you about each file when
			you use mget or mput.  "prompt" toggles this
	hash		will show hash marks (#) as it progresses
	binary		set transfer mode to binary
	ascii		set transfer mode to ascii (text)
	status		show the status of your ftp session

	Transfer mode - If you are ftp'ing binaries (like games, pictures,
	some compressed files) you need to set it to binary mode so that
	it doesn't mess up the transfer.  You can use binary mode for
	text transfers, so when in doubt, use binary.  (ascii mode is
	faster for text - it has something to do with the transfer method)
</pre>
<p>

<H3>Other interesting ftp clients:</H3>
    ncftp is a client that was written w/ many nifty features.
<br>      Among them are:<br>
<ul>
	<li>automatically logging you in through anonymous ftp.
	<li>prompt customization
	<li>memory of last site visited 
	<li>and many others.
</ul>

<p>

<H2>Archie</H2><br>
     <blockquote>
	Archie queries an archie anonymous FTP database looking for
     the specified string using the Prospero protocol.  This
     client is based on Prospero version Beta.4.2 and is provided
     to encourage non-interactive use of the Archie servers (and
     subsequently better performance on both sides).  This man
     page describes version 1.3 of the client.
<p>
     The general method of use is of the form
<pre>
          % archie string
</pre>
     This will go to the archie server and ask it to look for all
     known systems that have a file named `string' in their FTP
     area.  archie will wait, and print out any matches.
     Archie will also search based on substrings and regular expressions.<br>

<H2>USENET and FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)</H2><br>
	<blockquote>
	USENET is a system of bulletin boards.  USENET topics cover a 
	wide-range of topics.  They range from comic books to sewing;
	from computers to veganism.  To access these bulletin boards,
	use the trn program.  Type: "trn" at the shell and it will create
	a .newsrc in your home directory.  The .newsrc will contain all of 
	the newsgroups available to you.  It will ask you if there are any 
	particular subjects you'd like to read about.  
<p>
	As it turns out, people ask the same questions over and over again.
	"How do I set up Linux on my machine?"  "What kind of bait do you
	use in this situation?"  "Why is the sky blue?"
<p>	
	In response to this, FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) are written.
	These files are designed to anticipate most common questions and to
	answer them.  An archive of these wonderful files can be found
	through ftp at:  rtfm.mit.edu

<p>

<H2>Gopher</H2><br>
<blockquote>
<h3>Starting Gopher</H3><br>
	Gopher is really easy to use (kind of like a Macintosh): everything
is menu-driven.  You start on a main menu (the "root" gopher server) and
branch out from there.  Type "gopher" to start your gopher client.  If you
don't want to use the default gopher server, you can specify the one you want
here.  For instance, if I were on UCLink, and I wanted to go right to the
OCF's gopher, I could type "gopher ocf" from my UCLink prompt.
<p>
<H3>Using Gopher</H3><br>
	You begin gopher on a menu.  The current item is marked by "-->".
You can move it with the up and down arrows, and press the right arrow or
<return> key to select it.  If it is a menu, it will display it and wait for
you to choose another item.  If it is a text file, gopher will get it and
show it to you one page at a time.  You can also type an item's number to
select it.  You can always type "?" to get help.
<p>
	If the menu is bigger than gopher can display on your screen, it
will say what screen you are on in the lower right corner.  Press space to
move forward a screen or b to move back.  If it's really big (or you don't
want to use arrow keys at all) you can search for items with "/".  Typing 
n will repeat the last search.
<p>	
You can use the left arrow or u to move back menus, or m to go back
to the main menu.
<p>
<H3>Text Files</H3><br>
	There are a couple things you can do with the files gopher gets
for you.  First, you can just look at them, and then hit <return> to go back
to the previous menu.  You can also save it as a file in your account with 
"s".  It will ask for a file name.  If you want, you can tell it to download
it to your home computer (if that's where you are logged in from) with "D".
You can also use "p" to print it, but this usually doesn't print where you
want it to: it only prints to printers attached to your Internet site (like
the ocf's printers).  You can even mail it to yourself (or someone else) with
"m".
<p>
<H3>Bookmarks</H3><br>
	Gopherspace (as we refer to all the things gopher can access) is
huge.  Chances are, you'll be running around, picking menus with wild abandon
and you will find something you want to be able to get back to.  You're sure
there's an easier way to get here than the complicated route you just took
(or maybe there isn't), so you use a bookmark.  A bookmark is a way of
leaving a little mark someplace so you can get there easily later.  On a
specific item, you type "a" to add it to your bookmark list.  Then, later 
on, you can type "v" to view your bookmarks, and select from your favorite
places in gopherspace.  If you get sick of one, you can type "d" to delete
it from your bookmark list.  Bookmarks are one of the key things to using
gopher effectively: you build your own personal menu.
<p>
<H3>Besides Text</H3><br>
	There are many things gopher can offer you.  Items marked with "/"
are directories, and items that seem normal are probably text files.  There
are other things out there: <TEL> marks a telnet session.  Gopher will
connect you via telnet to some site.  <CSO> marks a name server that will
lookup people for you (like a phonebook).  <?> is a general symbol meaning
that gopher will ask you a question, like what keywords to search for, and
then go do it.  Two more are <Picture> and <), meaning a graphic and sound
respectively.  Most computers where you are using gopher can't access these
directly, although you can download them.
<p>
<H3>Quitting Gopher</H3><br>
	Type "q" to quit from any point within gopher.
</blockquote>
<p>
<H2>The Web</H2><br>
<blockquote>
	The World Wide Web consists of documents linked together with 
"hyperlinks".  You start on your "home page" and work your way out from
there.  Unlike gopher, there is no specific client.  Any "browser" that
understands the links can use the web.  Which one you use depends a lot
on what kind of hook-up you have.  If you are on a terminal (either in
a terminal room like 199 Cory or at home using a modem and communications
program) you are limited to text (no graphics) and can use "www" or "lynx"
This is fine, but to really get the most out of the web, you need some
sort of graphics terminal (i.e. xterm or PC/Mac on the Internet)  Then
you can use Mosaic: a graphical web browser.  For X, it's called xmosaic,
the PC's and Mac's just call it Mosaic or NSCA Mosaic.  There are other
programs as well, such as chimera.  We'll be concentrating on one of the
text browsers, lynx.  If you can use lynx, using Mosaic is easy to figure
out.  If you're computer doesn't have lynx, you can try "www".  Many of the
commands are the same.
<p>
<H3>About the format of the Web</H3><br>
	The Web uses an address form called a URL: Uniform Resource Locator.
The first part shows what type of resource it is, and last part is its
address on the internet.   Some resource examples are "http" for another
web server document and "file" for a simple text document.  The address 
consists of a machine name, and then the location of a file on that machine.
<p>
An example URL would be:
  <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/top.html">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/top.html</A>
<p>
Another cool one is:
  <A HREF="http://www.four11.com">http://www.four11.com</A>
<p>	
This is a web document.  It is written in HyperText Markup Language
(html).  This means it probably contains other hyperlinks, a well as
special formating information.
<p>
<H3>Lynx basics</H3><br>	
To start lynx, type "lynx".  It will load your default homepage.  If
you don't like that one, and you have another one, you can specify your
homepage: "lynx <homepage.html>" or whatever your homepage is called.  From
this home page, you can use the up and down arrows to move up and down
between highlighted words.  Each of those words is called an "anchor" - it 
is a link to another document.  You can press return or right arrow to get
next document, or left to go to the one before this one, and <space> to get
the next page.
<p>
	You can type h or help to get help, and q to quit.  If you aren't 
using lynx, and there a numbers in brackets after certain items instead
of highlights, you can press a number to follow a link.  You can type delete
to get a history list.  Type "o" to get options, and "m" to back to your
homepage.  You can also use the search command to search for keywords
in the current document.
<p>
	If you know a specific URL, you can use "g" to go to it directly.
You need to type the whole URL:
<em>  URL to open: http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/top.html</em>
<p>
<H4>Bookmarks</H4><br>
	Bookmarks on the web are similar to those in gopher.  When reading a
document, press "a" to add it to your bookmark list, and type "v" to access
your bookmarks.  You must specific your bookmark file within the options.
(Press "o" to get them)  Your bookmark page is just link another html file.
<p>
<H4>Options</H4><br>
	One of the most important options is the bookmark file.  You can
call it whatever you want, I recommend bookmarks.html or something similar.
It will store this information and all your other options in a file
called .lynxrc.  You can play with the other options.  For instance,
if you don't like arrow keys, you can specify that you want the vi or
emacs keys to work instead.  After making changes, type ">" to save them
and "r" to return to lynx.

<p>

<H3>Netscape/Mosaic (Graphical Browsers on your tour of the InfoBahn)</H3><br>
	Using netscape or Mosaic is very similar to Lynx.  To start up 
Mosaic type: "Mosaic" or "xmosaic".  To start up netscape type: "netscape".
The biggest difference between netscape/Mosaic and Lynx is that you can view
inlined pictures.  A friendly, easy-to-use interface is provided.
<p>
	To go to a site in Mosaic:  click on "File" and drag down to 
				 <em>   "Open URL..."</em><br>
        To go to a site in netscape:  click on "File" and drag down to
				   </em> "Open Location..."</em>
<p>
There are very helpful "Help" menus at the top right corner of the window.
Click on that if you get confused or if you'd like to learn more about 
netscape/Mosaic.

<H2>Downloading/Uploading</H2><br>
<blockquote>	
Many people want to know how to get files from their Internet 
account to their home computer.  There are many reasons why you might
want to do this: you found a game or useful program on some ftp site, you
found an archive of GIF's (computer pictures) that you want to see on your
computer, or maybe you're running our of room on your account and you can
store some of that information on your hard drive.  Whatever the reason,
you need to establish a transfer of files between your PC or Mac and your
Internet computer.
<p>	
Luckily, most (if not all) communications software comes with this
ability.  If you've used your comm. program at all, you noticed something
"SEND" and "RECEIVE" options, or "Z-modem" or "Kermit".  These are all 
transfer protocols (like ftp is a transfer protocol for UNIX machines) 
between modems.  The most common one is Zmodem.  To use it from UNIX,
you type "sz <filename>".  If it is a binary (which it probably is)
you should use "sz -b <filename>", although most sz's automagically do this.
Then, one of two things happen: either your modem program picks up and says
"Aha!  I'm getting Zmodem" and it will begin its side of the transfer
automatically, or (especially with older programs) you need to tell your
program to "Receive Zmodem".  This will usually work.  If it doesn't, you
might see what options are available on your communications program.
<p>	
There are other protocols available if Zmodem does not function
(or your program doesn't support it).  There's also Ymodem and Xmodem.  Read
the man page on sz (or sx/sy) for more info.  Also, there's kermit.
<p>	
Kermit is slower than Zmodem.  Type "kermit -help" to get a little
information.  Basically, you type "kermit -s <files>" to send and 
"kermit -r" to receive.
<p>	
Sending files from your home computer to UNIX is just the opposite.
You type "rz" or "rz -b" and the computer responds with "ready... type
sz file to your modem program" and then you select "Send Zmodem" with your
modem program.  Again, if this doesn't work, try a different protocol.
