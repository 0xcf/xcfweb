-What is it?-
USENET overview
	USENET is a big collection of electronic bulletin boards (not
BBS's!)  People post articles to "newsgroups" and you "subscribe" to those
newsgroups and read their articles and post "followups".  There are
currently some 3000-4000 newsgroups.

Programs to use (rn, trn, nn, tin, Pnews, newsetup, newsgroups)
	There are several programs that you can use to "read" newsgroups.
They are called "newsreaders": rn, trn, nn, and tin are some of the more
popular ones.  rn is a basic newsreader, trn is much like rn but it allows
you to read "threads" (which are basically articles with the same subject),
and nn and tin are slightly more graphical.  We recommend that you use trn,
but you can use any newsreader you can find.  Posting to newsgroups is done
with the Pnews command.  The program newsetup is run when you start reading
news the first time.  If you want to see a list of newsgroups you can 
subscribe to, you can run newsgroups.  (there are many more newsreaders
out there... if you like GNU, you can use GNUS)

Customizing it (.newsrc, .cshrc, .signature)
	All the news reader programs (well, most of them) use a file
called .newsrc in your home directory.  The format is:
	newsgroup: articles_read
	It lists a name, a colon if you're subscribed (and a ! if you're not)
and the range of articles in that group that you have read.  If you want
to edit your .newsrc, go ahead!  You can change ":" to "!" and vice-versa
to decide which groups you want and don't want.  The first time you run
a newsreader, it should create a .newsrc for you (via the newsetup command).
If there aren't many newsgroups in it, then you can subscribe to ones you
want.  See "Using trn".
	There are a few things that you can add to your .cshrc or .login to
customize your news reading.  If you like a certain editor, like
/usr/local/bin/pico, you can put the following lines in your .cshrc:
	setenv EDITOR /usr/local/bin/pico
	setenv VISUAL /usr/local/bin/pico
	(or whatever editor you want to use)
	Also, the following line will set which computer to get news from:
	setenv NNTPSERVER agate.berkeley.edu
	(It's probably the default, since agate is the only newserver on
campus)
	As you read news, you will see that people have a "signature" on
the articles they post.  You can create your own, but it shouldn't be longer
than four lines.  Call it .signature and put it in your home directory.  If
you use pine, it will add your .signature to your mail, too.

Getting more help (gopher, man)
	As always, we recommend you read the man page for any questions you
have.  However, we all know that man pages are, at best, unwieldy.  Therefore,
we also suggest that you look in UCLink's gopher "gopher uclink" and look
in help/USENET.  Feel free to send questions to staff@ocf.

-Newsgroups-
How to find newsgroups
	First, new users of USENET should subscribe to news.announce.newusers.
The information there can show you many things you should know, like 
how to find new groups, how to create new groups, and some pointers on what
we call "netiquette".  You can use the newsgroups command (it's pretty slow)
to find other newsgroups.  Some of the more popular hierarchies are:
	comp	computer stuff
	news	news about news
	rec	recreational stuff
	sci	scientific
	soc	social
	talk	well, talk.
	misc	misc
	clari	real news (moderated news groups)
	alt	Anything else (you might not be able to get all alt.* groups)
	ba	Bay Area
	ca	California
	ucb	That's us.

-Using trn-
Starting up
	Typing trn will start up the newsreader.   It has a couple of useful
options: "-q" will do a quick start that won't check for new newsgroups, and
you can check the manual for some others.  You can type "q" just about
anywhere to back out of trn.  Also, you can type the spacebar to do the
default action, which is usually appropriate.  Press h at any time for help.

Selecting newsgroups and articles
	trn will present you with a line similar to:
=======  10 unread articles in rec.humor.oracle -- read now? [+ynq]
	Pressing space will do the default, choosing this newsgroup.  "y"
will show you all articles, rn style, "+" will show you the articles threaded,
and "n" moves to the next newsgroup with unread articles.
	To take advantage of trn's capabilities, use the +.
	You can move between newsgroups with n for next, p for previous, and
g <name> to go to a specific newsgroup.  You may be asked if you want to
subscribe to that group if you weren't already.  You can also subscribe to
many similar newsgroups with "a <name>" where it will ask you if you want
to add all the newsgroups that have <name> in their titles. "u" will 
unsubscribe to the current newsgroup, and "c" will catch-up all articles.
	If you pressed "y", it will start showing you articles.  If you
pressed "+" (the spacebar usually defaults to +) it will present a thread 
selector.  Each thread is marked with a letter, press that letter to "mark"
the thread.  Press ">" to go to the next page of threads.  Press Z or tab
to start reading the articles marked.  When you are done, it will return to 
the thread selector screen.  You can also press X to have it show the
articles you wanted and mark the others as if you had read them (i.e., you
don't want to read them)  You can press c to catch up all articles. 
(mark them as read)  Return will start reading the current thread if none
are selected,  and D will read current articles and mark the current page
as read.  Entering a range of letters, like "b-f" will select all threads
in that range.

Reading articles
	trn will simply display all articles you selected, in thread order.
You can press n to go to the next article, p for previous, or q for quit.
The spacebar defaults to n, unless the article is long, where space will
show you more of the article.  You can also press "<" and ">" to move
between threads (not articles)  "s" and "w" will save the current article 
to the file you specify, where "s" includes headers and "w" does not.  You can
press "b" to go back one page in a longer article.  From time to time, you
will see articles that seem to be gibberish, these have been encoded so that
it's your choice if you want to read them.  (They are usually offensive or
degrading in some way)  If you're sure that you want to read them, pressing
x will decode the article.  If you press x, it implies that you understand
that it may be offensive.

Responding
	Pressing r after an article will send a mail message to the author.
Pressing f will post a followup to the article to the newsgroup.  You can
also include the original article with R and F respectively.

Paging through an article-
	q	end of article
	<space> next page
	b	back page
	<return>one more line
	d	show half a page more
	j	mark article as read (junk)
	<tab>	skip text from previous articles

-Using Pnews-
Pnews
	Pnews is the program that you use to post articles to the newsgroups.
It can be invoked from the UNIX prompt, and it is also invoked when you
"followup" an article from within a newsreader.  The first thing it asks
you is for "distribution".  Usually, for ucb.* newsgroups, the distribution
is ucb.  If you want it to escape the university, you can choose whatever
is appropriate for your article.  Remember, this is the Internet, and "world"
means EVERYBODY gets your article.  It will ask you for a file to include,
if you have typed you article already, give the filename here.  (It will also
ask if you're really, really, really sure about posting.  If you are, go 
ahead.)  It may ask for the editor you want to use.  If it doesn't, and
you haven't specified one (in your .cshrc) you will get vi.  You probably
don't want this.  Type ":q!" and fix it.  After specifying newsgroups to
post to, and writing your article, type "send" to send it.  If you want to
test anything out, send it to the "ucb.test" newsgroup.  You will get an e-mail
message back with your headers (not your article itself).

-Creating new groups-
	If you've got a really good idea (remember, everyone thinks they
have a really good idea) you can get a new newsgroup created.  Check 
news.announce.newusers for information.
