</tr></table>
<p>
	This class will cover some of the fundamental concepts
that are common across different GUI toolkits and demonstrate
a simple program, implemented in Motif, Xaw, Gtk, & Tk.  The
students will then implement a small program in the toolkit
of their choice, while we provide assistance as necessary.

<td>CGI Programming</td><td align=right>9/25/96 7-9pm</td>
</tr></table>
<p>
	Interactivity on the web cannot be accomplished without CGI, or the
	Common Gateway Interface.  In this session we will go over a few
	simple methods of processing and maintaining an information database.
	The example we will be using is the XCF helpsession signup, as well
	as brief discussion of the Text Science Blackboard.
<p>
<em>
Instructors  : Gene Kan<br>
Prerequisites: Perl is advised, but not required.  We won't concentrate too
much on the perl, rather, we'll talk more about the methods and techniques
which make CGI processing a little less painful.<br>

<p>
If you are curious about the internal workings of UNIX, curious about
how your favorite applications work, or want to write UNIX software,
this help session is for you.
We will be covering: processes (learn how to start child processes and
control them), file io (file descriptors and inodes, file syscalls), how
to manage memory (with advanced system calls such as mmap), and interprocess
communication and networking.
