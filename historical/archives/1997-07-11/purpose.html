<center><H2>What is the XCF?</H2></center>

The XCF is a student organization whose aim it is to support and organize
students who are interested in working on computer projects. We provide
students with a comfortable lab and plenty of computer resources to help
them complete their projects. We have weekly meetings where we discuss
progress and provide advice on each other's projects.
<p>

A tremendous amount of cooperation takes place in the XCF. We regularly
share source code, paradigms, and criticisms. We ask our members to interact
with each other as much as possible, thus providing a motivating and
productive atmosphere in the XCF office.
<p>

Our focus is on getting work done while keeping up with schoolwork and
other interests. Being surrounded by a group of bright and hard-working
students has proven to be very effective in increasing productivity.
Consequently, we are always looking for bright, diligent, social members.
