<title>So, how do I join the XCF?</title>

<h3>Who Should Join the XCF</h3>

If you're a motivated student interested in producing software and are
able and willing to spend time during the semester and during the summer
working on a project, if you're a team worker, if you're friendly and
like to contribute to a group of other talented and motivated students,
then we would like to invite you to join the XCF.
<p>
You should pick a project (either with a professor as CS199, or your own
project), and submit a project proposal to the
<a href="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">XCF director</a>.
<p>
You should consult our list of
<a href="available.html">project suggestions</a> just to get a feel of what
type of project we're looking for.
