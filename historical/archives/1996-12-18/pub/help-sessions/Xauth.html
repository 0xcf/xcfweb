MIT X, OpenWindows, Motif, MacX
THIS ARTICLE IS OF IMPORTANCE TO ALL X USERS.  PLEASE READ!

One of the most powerful aspects of the X Window System is the ability
to display X clients (eg. xterm) on remote displays.  For example, it
is common to log in to a remote system from your local workstation, or
Mac, run an X program on that remote system, and display it on your
local workstation.  This is often achieved by using the command "xhost
+" on your local workstation to disable access control.

Although the flexibility is useful, the possibility for abuse is
considerable.  There has been one recent instance of a cracker grabbing
passwords by connecting to unsecured X servers.

It is therefore STRONGLY recommended that you DO NOT use the command
"xhost +" to allow access to your display.  MacX users must have
"Access Control" checked.

Quick Fix
- ---------

For both MIT X (twm, mwm, etc.) and OpenWindows (olwm), use the
command 'xhost +hostname' to enable access to your display from
'hostname'.  Note that this is not very secure since any user on
'hostname' can access your X server (and potentially do nasty things).
For more secure methods, read the next section.

MacX users must  enable "Access Control" under the Remote menu.  With
access control checked, you will get an alert whenever someone tries to
connect. You can then click OK to accept, or cancel to dismiss.
Otherwise, anyone can establish a connection without notice. In
particular, someone could then snarf whatever you were typing - e.g.
into a xterm window, etc.  This is the only level of security for 
MacX users, you should continue reading if you also use other X
displays (Unix, X-Term, etc.).

The Secure Way
- --------------

It is impossible to make X totally secure in our environment.  You can,
however, make it extremely difficult for casual snooping.  Below are
suggestions listed from most to least desirable for both MIT X and
OpenWindows users.  

1. If running OpenWindows and Secure RPC, use 'xhost +user@hostname'.
   This currently doesn't work on most installations at LBL.

2. *OpenWindows* is automatically started with support
   for Xauthority, a user-based access control mechanism.  
   (See the description of MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 below.)

   The *MIT X* server normally started with 'twm' or 'mwm' must be be
   started differently to use the Xauthority mechanism.  Place the
   following in your .xinitrc file:

   	HOST=`hostname`
   	randomkey=`perl -e 'srand; printf int(rand(1e16))'`
	xauth add ${HOST}/unix:0 . $randomkey
	xauth add ${HOST}:0 . $randomkey

   and invoke X with the command: 'xinit -- -auth ~/.Xauthority'

   In the case of both OpenWindows and MIT X, using Xauthority:

   If your home directory is shared by remote machines,
   then you can display on your local workstation as long
   as the remote X client is running under the same user id.

   If your home directory is not shared by the remote
   machine, you can use the 'auth' command as follows:

	xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh remhost xauth merge -

   If you are using different user id's on each machine, you
   must use the method number three, below.

3. If you must, use 'xhost +hostname'.  This isn't secure
   either because any user on 'hostname' can attach to the X server on
   your workstation, but it is more secure than 'xhost +'.

   You could use xhost to enable access from a specific host only
   long enough to start up a client, and then disable access
   immediately.  For example, a script might do something like:

	xhost +remhost
	rsh remhost xterm -display myhost:0
	sleep 15 
	xhost -remhost


MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
- ------------------
When you start your X server as in suggestion number two above, it
stores a code (or cookie) in a file called ".Xauthority" in your home
directory.  Once the cookie is stored, other clients must present the
it to the X server before being allowed to display or connect to the
server.  Since clients get the cookie by reading it from the file
".Xauthority", access control is based on Unix file permissions.  The
normal permissions for ".Xauthority" are "rw" for the owner of the
file (yourself).  If you are running clients from a remote machine, the
remote machine must be mounting the *same* home directory containing
the ".Xauthority" file, or you will have to use the "xauth" command as
in suggestion two.  To enable access for remote or local users, 
other than yourself, use the "Quick Fix" method, or see the "xauth"
man page for more secure ways using a cookie.
