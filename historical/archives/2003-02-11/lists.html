The list files for gimp-user and advanced-java were hacked or otherwise
corrupted.  To participate in these forums, you will have to resubscribe.
I apologize.  I have no idea what happened.

We apologize to all advanced-java subscribers.  Someone changed an
rc file causing Qmail to not start.  The system was rebooted, and
voila: no mail delivery.  I've just fixed that, and you should start
getting full mailboxes again.

<A NAME="unsubscribing"><H3>A note on unsubscribing</H3></A>
<P CLASS="text">It is normal to experience a several day (up to one
week) lag after unsubscribing from a list.  This is due to the
transaction semantics of our mailing agent: any message which is
already in the delivery queue at the time of your unsubscription bears
your address as a destination.  Unfortunately, we cannot modify the
queue without jeopardizing its consistency.  You will notice residual
mail especially on high-volume lists such as Advanced-Java.</P>
