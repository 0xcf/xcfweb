<TITLE>Writing an XCF Project Proposal</TITLE>

</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P CLASS="text">This note describes the how and why of writing an XCF
project proposal.  If you do not know about the XCF or XCF projects,
check out <A HREF="purpose.html">the XCF purpose</A>.</P>

<P CLASS="text">The project proposal, obviously, begins with a project
idea.  If you do not have an idea for a project, you can check out the
<A HREF="available.html">available projects page</A>.  Ideas are not
very easy to think up, so those that we have may not be inspiring.  We
have noticed that people that come up with their own projects seem to
do better.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Once you have written a proposal (2 or 3 pages is
typical), or if you have questions or comments, email
<A HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">
director@xcf</A>.  We may also be able to help if you have an idea but
need help refining it.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Finally, note that the guidelines here can be
stretched.</P>

<H3>Purpose of XCF projects</H3>

<P CLASS="text">The objective of an XCF project is to enhance the
education of motivated students by providing resources and direction
in pursuing a programming idea, and also to produce something useful
for the campus computing community.</P>

<P CLASS="text">The following is a set of guidelines.  If there is a
good, clear reason, exceptions can be made.  In general we are more
interested in positive results than anything else, and nothing
compares to a finished project.

<H3>Purpose of a proposal</H3>

<P CLASS="text">A project proposal has three objectives:</P>

<OL>

<LI>To describe the project so that it can be evaluated for approval
by the current XCF membership.  You are selling your idea, so be sure
to explain it clearly an concisely.  Don't get sidetracked; it is
helpful to start with an outline.

<LI>Ensure that the project has been well thought out to the point
where a clear summary can be written.  This will help as an exercise
in writing (you will have to write documentation for your project) and
as an exercise in planning a software project (you will never have a
project approved by someone in either industry or academia without a
clear plan).

<LI>Provide a summary for our sponsors.  For this reason the proposal must
be clearly written.  Also, game projects must be kept to a low
proportion if we are to be taken seriously.  We have developed a
standard format (see below) for proposals so that they can be reviewed
quickly.
</OL>

<H3>Sections of an XCF project proposal</H3>

<P CLASS="text">Keep your writing style simple and to the point.
Humor should be used sparingly and only in good taste, if at all.  The
following is the accepted format for a proposal.</P>

<HR>

<DL>
<DT><H4>Title</H4>
<DD>
<P CLASS="text">Give it a descriptive title so that everyone can refer
to the project in the same manner.  You do not need to come up with a
"name" yet; it is more important to have a one sentence description.

<DT><H4>Summary</H4>
<DD><P CLASS="text">The summary should be one paragraph that indicates
briefly the what and why of this project.  Do not go into detail.</P>

<DT><H4>Description</H4>
<DD><P CLASS="text">This section should fill in the details of what,
why, and how for the project.  The "why" part should describe a
problem that could be solved with the project (perhaps a "background
and purpose" subsection).  The "how" should discuss the mechanisms
that need to be built for the project (e.g. garbage collection, an X
interface, etc.).  A section on possible extensions should list ideas
that would be nice but are not part of the basic project; you are not
signing up to work on the extensions, but you should try to structure
the project such that the extensions could be added easily later.</P>

<DT><H4>Time line</H4>
<DD><P CLASS="text">This section should be a list of intermediate
goals in the project, along with your best guess as to how many hours
it takes to complete each goal.  You should be able to check off each
goal in order.</P>

<P CLASS="text">We request hours and not weeks for the following
reasons: as a student, your first priority is class work; class work
can take up more time than anticipated, and frequently projects are
put off.  Delaying a project is not so bad if you have a clear reason
behind it (i.e. "goal #3 took 28 hours instead of the planned 16,
where I have put in four hours per week, resulting in a three week
delay" or "due to midterms, I could put in only eight hours on my
project for the month of March").</P>

<P CLASS="text">Secondly, it is a good exercise to think through how
much time you think the project will take.  If you do not have a basis
for making these estimates, than the only way you will learn is to
start now by making guesses.  Once these guesses are written down, you
can come back and watch your progress and get feedback.  Estimating
time is a valuable skill, and part of the educational aspect of an XCF
project.  Note also that it is generally accepted that any estimate
will turn out low, so don't worry too much about being accurate.
Remember, in the end it's for your benefit.</P>

<P CLASS="text">(I could go on if you are not convinced, but I will
spare you for now.)</P>

<DT><H4>Resources required</H4>
<DD><P CLASS="text">We assume that a reasonable amount of disk space,
CPU cycles, access to a console, and a C compiler and libraries are
required; This section should highlight any exceptional requirements
that might be involved.  For example, a project requiring a large
database should list the best estimate of disk space (or simply
"enough disk to hold the dictionary").  Another project may require a
lisp interpreter, access to the INGRES database system, or a
collection of typical electrical circuit schematics.</P>

<P CLASS="text">All resources required should be listed whether or not
they are supplied by the XCF (e.g. you have a large database elsewhere
that could not fit on the XCF machines); this indicates to our
sponsors how effectively our resources meet the goals of the XCF.</P>

<DT><H4>Applicant's Qualifications and University Affiliation</H4>
<DD><P CLASS="text"> The XCF can only provide resources for registered
students (grad or undergrad) or UC staff.  Please indicate which (and
year).</P>

<P CLASS="text">List CS course-work or other course-work that may be
relevant to the project (please do _not_ include grades).  List work
experience, if any, and finally list any projects that you have worked
on or completed (even class projects if you like).</P>

<P CLASS="text">Note also that your ability to come up with a good
project proposal reflects on your general organizational skills.</P>

<DT><H4>Relevance</H4>

<DD><P CLASS="text">This describes your view of how this project can
be useful to the campus computing community (or the computing
community in general) or other reasons you think this project has
merit.  This is a good place to address possible weaknesses in the
project goals.</P>

<P CLASS="text">The following information will be added to the project
proposal then it is approved (then it becomes the "project
description"):</P>

<DL>
<DT>Sponsors Name 
<DD>There will be a single XCF member assigned as a sponsor.  They are
responsible for helping you out with programming problems, pointing
you to other people who might help you, creating your account,
introducing you to new members, etc.  In the past this has not
actually made much of a difference, as questions are usually answered
by whom ever is available.

<DT>Applicants Name
<DD>(Obvious).

<DT>Date Started
<DD>And/or date approved.
</DL>

</DL>
<HR>

<H3>Approval of a project proposal</H3>

<P CLASS="text">The approval of an XCF project is made by general
consensus of the membership and based on the following two
criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Utility or creativity:</STRONG> The XCF wants to see
projects that will be useful to the campus community (or the general
programming community) once they are complete.  This is a stated goal
of the XCF.  If there is no obvious utility, a notably interesting or
creative project idea may gain support.  Note that games present a
problem in that they have very little real utility, reflect poorly on
the XCF to our sponsors, and tend to have a negative affect on the
working environment within the XCF.

<LI><STRONG>Probability of success:</STRONG> It is not worth anyone's
time or effort to start a project that will not be finished.  The
general membership will examine the complexity and size of a project
and compare it with your qualifications and their own experience.  If
the project seems particularly ambitious, you may be asked to trim it
down, leaving portions as "possible extensions".  On the other hand, a
particularly simple project given your qualification may not be
appropriate either, and you would be asked to add to the proposal.
</OL>

<H3>Miscellaneous comments</H3>

<P CLASS="text">Some projects have built-in negatives; in particular,
game projects and new programming language projects.  Game playing in
the XCF is usually banned during the semester for several reasons; it
is obviously inconsistent to have a game project while game playing is
banned.</P>

<P CLASS="text">[The following paragraph is the personal opinion of
one XCF member and may or may not reflect the opinions of other XCF
members.]</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P CLASS="text">As for new programming languages, everyone seems to
have their own idea of what should or should not be in a programming
language.  Unfortunately, most have not really researched the topic
very well.  It turns out to be very difficult to do something
innovative in this area, especially considering the time you are
expected to spend on the project.  As for the utility of a new
programming language, so many programming languages exist that it is
unlikely that a new language will be accepted.  Implementations of
existing programming languages (which are not commonly available) are
a different matter.  If you do present a language proposal (either new
or old), it would help considerably to have taken CS 164 (programming
languages and compilers).</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P CLASS="text">The time to approve a proposal can vary widely; the
most time is spent collecting feedback from current members and
getting the proposal revised.  It helps to try to minimize the number
of times a proposal is revised (that is why this note was written).
During finals is the worst time to submit a proposal; during breaks
many people will be on vacation.  The best time to submit a proposal
is at the beginning of a semester, ideally a week or two before the
semester starts.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Doing a project with the XCF implies that it can be
used by the campus computing community.  Beyond that, we do not care
if you take your project afterwards to improve and sell for profit
(University rules not withstanding).</P>

<P CLASS="text">Finally, once a proposal has been accepted, you are
expected to help maintain a good working environment in the XCF.</P>
