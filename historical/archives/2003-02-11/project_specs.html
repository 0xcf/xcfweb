<H3><LI><A NAME="1">Utility or theoretical interest</A></H3>
<P CLASS="text">XCF projects must either be useful to the general
computing community or be of defensible theoretical interest.</P>

<H3><LI><A NAME="2">Scope and completability</A></H3>

<P CLASS="text"If the project is managed internally by XCF, meaning it
is not managed by a faculty member, then it must be scoped to be
completable in the time stated by the developer.  Typically, we would
like to see what could be called a useful prototype, demonstrating a
large portion of the project's intended capabilities, within one
year.</P>

<P CLASS="text">In our experience, one year is less than it seems due
to the pressures of schoolwork, outside employment, and shortcomings
in the wheel.  So scope will be restricted keeping that in mind.  Of
course, different people work at different rates, so there is always
room for developers to expand the scope of their projects once
demonstrable progress has been made on the stated goals.  Scope
requirements <STRONG>do not</STRONG> impinge on the possibilities of a
project if the project is properly designed.  XCF projects must,
therefore, be properly designed.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Finally, projects must focus on clearly defined
goals.</P>

<H3><LI><A NAME="3">Progress</A></H3>

<P CLASS="text">Regular progress must be made.  Members are expected
to police themselves.  In the event of unsatisfactory effort toward
the member's stated project or peripheral projects (hacks unrelated to
the stated project, system maintenance, etc.), then members are
expected to excuse themselves from an active role in XCF until they
once again have time to contribute to the organization.  This will be
enforced.</P>

<P CLASS="text">We are understanding of temporary scheduling
difficulties and we like to keep our members happy and our
organization at the forefront of technology.  Part of that is
maintaining a high level of productivity.</P>

<H3><LI><A NAME="4">Proposals</A></H3>

<P CLASS="text">Project proposals should be submitted to <A
HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">director@xcf.berkeley.edu</A>.
After the proposal is reviewed by the Director it is submitted to the
general membership for review.  Project proposals must address the
preceding criteria (1-3).</P>

<P CLASS="text">We will not accept hopelessly overscoped projects or
applicants who will not contribute positively to our environment.</P>
