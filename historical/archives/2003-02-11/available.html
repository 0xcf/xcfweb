<P CLASS="text">The following are some ideas for projects, collected
from various XCF members.  For more information on these projects, or
new project ideas, please get in touch with <A

<DT><H3>Drawing Program</H3>
<DD>
GTK is a very nice toolkit, one which could probably
replace the horrible interface of xfig without too much difficulty.
This project could get you a reasonable ammount of internet-freeware
fame.  I have looked at the code and evaluated the difficulty,
it doesn't look too hard.  To really rule, you'd add a few missing
features.  You would not be just porting to GTK, the interface sorely
needs a redesign.  Contact <A HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">
jmacd@xcf.berkeley.edu</A>, and look at the program "Dia".

<DT><H3>Project Manager</H3>
<DD>
Think Technologies Think C (subsequently know as Symantec Think
C) had a very user friendly project system which behaved very much like
UNIX make. This was such a good idea that VC++ supports projects. It would
be neat to implement an interface to make, makedepend, gcc -M, CVS (or
better yet, PRCS), autoconf, and package all of this in a graphical project
manager.  It would allow the user to easily add new source files and
libraries to his project, easily perform checkins and checkouts, and
facilitate packing. 
<P>
An interface to emacs is crucial to the acceptance of this package. Contact
<A HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">ali@xcf.berkeley.edu</A>.
Also contact <A HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">jmacd@xcf.berkeley.edu</A>
because he knows the GNU software maintenence tools pretty well, and has some
ideas about features the GNU utilities lack in Solaris' make.

<DT><H3>Extensible Web Crawler</H3>
<DD>
An extensible web crawler would provide a basic architecture
for crawling the web.  It could be implemented as a C library, allowing
extensions in C/C++, or it could have an embedded Tcl or Perl
interpreter, allowing people to write a web crawler in a common
scripting language.  This project would be useful anytime you are
doing an in depth search for information on the web.  Heuristics
could be developed to order documents by importance.

<DT><H3>RPC for Scheme</H3>
<DD>
Wouldn't it be neat if you could have remote execution of Scheme
functions with parameter passing and the whole works? Contact
<A HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">ali@xcf.berkeley.edu</A>.

<DT><H3>Transparent windows</H3>
<DD>
Experiments by <A HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">Gene</A> and
<A HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">Ali</A> show that it's possible
to hack up a window manager to make windows transparent on request. We
envision a WM hack which allows the user to make a window transparent
by pressing a key, and having the window turn back to opaque when the
key is released. This function would allow a more transient
"raise-lower" operation which allows the user to take quick peeks at
windows that are lower in the stacking order.
