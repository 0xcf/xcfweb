>Segmented User Interaction</A
></H1
><P
>Because of the above fact, one of the most frustrating aspects
of CGI programming is the fact that interaction with the user [through
HTML forms] is segmented up into web-page-sized chunks.  Since the
program does not continue to run between multiple form submissions,
data from previous stages of processing must somehow be saved for
future pages to deal with. </P
><P
>Because of this, complex CGI programs often take the form of a
collection of programs, each which processes one form and which each
have the ability to do the necessary processing.  Libraries of common
program behavior [accessing server-stored files, etc] are crucial to
CGI programming.</P
><P
>This is where the topic of persistence comes into play most
importantly.  Say, for instance, that the CGI program determines user
information and authorization on the first page; on the third page,
that data is required.  What happens to the data in the mean time?
Since the CGI programs stop running, the data cannot be simply stored
into a data structure in memory and accessed later when
necessary... what to do, what to do?</P
><P
>There are a few solutions to this problem:
<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Require the user to authorize on the second page.  If
the user's authorization isn't really required to create the second
page, then this may be an option... but in general the user's
authorization is required as early as possible [so the appropriate
data can be shown] and near the end of the processing [to authorize
changes being made to data].</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Store the user's authorization data on the web server.
A combination of the IP address of the client, a timestamp and the
identity should work, given a reasonable timeout|expiration value.
But if the user goes to get a cup of coffee and comes back to finish
processing the form, the timeout will have expired and the user will
have to re-authorize... which isn't the best thing in the
world.</P

>Client-side persistence through
<I

>hidden</I
> fields.  The
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&lt;INPUT&gt;</TT
> HTML form field has a special type of
"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HIDDEN</TT
>", the basic meaning of which is that it
will be submitted with the form, but it is not displayed by the web
browser with the form.  However, since it is part of the HTML of the
form, it could conceivably be edited by the client, and this can
introduce a security hole of sorts.</P

>Client-side persistence with cookies.  This is another
viable option, but with the following caveats:
<P

><LI
><P
>Some people hate cookies, and don't accept them.  If
the cookie isn't accepted, then your script won't work.  If you use
cookies, have a backup system [like hidden fields] if the cookies
aren't accepted.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Cookies, stored on the client machine, are also open
for editing.  However, editing is a little easier to do than with
hidden fields.</P

>Define an authorization realm in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.htaccess</TT
> on the server, and use it to protect
the CGI URL. The client will need to authorize when reaching the CGI
URL, and authorization will be implicit through the rest of
processing.  This is a great solution to user authorization
persistence, but any other stored, persistent data will need to be
handled by one of the other methods.</P

>None of these solutions are really elegant (well... the last one
is pretty nice).  This fact is what makes CGI programming a royal pain
after a while.</P
><P
>This segmented user interaction must be designed into the
program from the beginning.  One of the most important things you can
do after you have the concept of what the CGI program is going to do
[overall], is to decide through mock-ups of the forms how it is going
to go about doing it.  The data required for each stage of processing
must be determined before hand and carried throughout the different
stages of processing.  Design is very important in CGI programming for
all but the simplest programs.</P
