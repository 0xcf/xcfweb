>There are a couple of specific security issues to be concerned
with while writing CGI programs.  Both or neither may apply to any
given CGI program, but both must be considered when writing a CGI
program.</P

>Watch what is done with form data.</A
></H2
><P
>If form data is requested from the user, chances are that it
will be processed and used by the program for internal purposes.  The
important thing to look for is that user-supplied data is not passed
verbatim to any sort of execution call.</P
><P
>An execution call is something that will perform an effect on
the system, such as starting a program [eg:
'<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>exec(...)</TT
>' in C/C++] or interpreting a statement
in the programming language being used [eg: '<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eval</TT
>'
in perl].  A malicious user may figure out what is going on, and a
well-crafted string delivered through the HTML form may be
inadvertently passed on to the execution call, which may then remove
files from the system, give the malicious user access to the system,
or any other number of nasty things.</P

>Don't allow access to binaries.</A
></H2
><P
>This is especially an issue with perl.  If the perl executable
is available in the [oft-used] <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cgi-bin/</TT
>
directory, then a user can get at the executable directly.  Since perl
has a command-line option to execute arbritary perl commands, this
would allow a malicious user to execute any perl command, giving them
a perfect opportunity to stage a [probably successful] attack on the
machine in question.</P
