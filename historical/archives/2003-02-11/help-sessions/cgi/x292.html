>Most programs are written with the assumption that only one copy
will be running at any given time.  Therefore, access to data files
will only be made by one copy of the program.  However, that is not
always true of CGI programs, for which any number of copies may be
running at any one time [one for each user submitting a form].  For
reading of data files, where no changes are being made, this isn't a
problem.  But as soon as modification of the data files [through
writing] is introduced, this becomes a major problem.</P
><P
>If one process is writing a file while the other is reading, the
reading process may read only partially-written data, resulting in
incomplete data.  If two processes are writing at the same time, their
data may be interleaved and completely unusable.  This can result in
corrupt and lost data.</P
><P
>The [somewhat] simple answer to this problem is file locking.
Any process which is going to write to a data file must first obtain a
lock on the file, before doing it's writing.  All others must wait for
the first process to finish before continuing.  If the programming
environment supports native file locking, use it.  If not, a lock file
created by writing processes before touching the files and deleted
when they are done can be used.  All other processes must check for
the existence of this file before proceeding, and if the file exists
must periodically check back to see if it's been deleted, and they can
continue.  However, using a lock file is not an ideal solution because
a race condition [where two processes run near-simultaneously and both
think that they have the lock] may develop.  Native file locking is
the best solution, since it usually is set up in such a way as to
limit race conditions.</P
