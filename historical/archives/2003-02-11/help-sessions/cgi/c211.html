including many involving security.  Many of these issues, as well, are
platform-specific.  If in doubt, consult your own knowledge base or
your local CGI expert.</P

><P
>Since CGI programs are run on the web server, they have the full
privledges of any program which can be run on the web server.  CGI
programs have access to any and all files and devices which any other
program would have.  This is a double-edged sword, however, because
though this means that CGI programs can draw upon any resources
available on the server machine [databases, log files, attached
hardware, etc], they also can corrupt and/or disrupt these same
resources if used incorrectly.</P
><P
>If running in a single-user environment [Windows95, WindowsNT,
MacOS, etc], this can be especially dangerous because the single user
[and any user programs] have full access to the machine, with
relatively few safeguards in place.</P
><P
>If running, however, on a multi-user machine [Unix], there may
be appropriate mechanisms in place to help limit the amount of
[potential] damage which a rogue CGI script can do.  It can also limit
the data which the CGI would have access to, but careful planning can
avoid this problem.</P
><P
>Allowing the CGI program to have access to files on the server
has many advantages.  First, it gives the CGI program the ability to
refer to files with more information.  For instance, a CGI program may
be able to connect to a product-information database and return
product information to the user, without requiring all the data to be
formatted into HTML pages ahead of time.  Secondly, it gives the CGI
program the much more important ability to write and store information
on the web server.  This allows the CGI program to have persistence of
data.  The user may fill out a form, the content of which the CGI
program saves and associated with a userid which is given to the user.
The next time the user uses the CGI program, they can give their
userid, and the information given beforehand can be recalled without
the user re-entering it to whatever end is deemed necessary.</P
