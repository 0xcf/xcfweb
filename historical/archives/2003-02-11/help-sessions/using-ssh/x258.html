><P
>SSH has many configuration options, which are settable both on the
command line and also in two configuartion files.  One, in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ssh_config</TT
> on UNIX machines, exists
system-wide, and sets up the default configuration options.  The second, in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.ssh/config</TT
> on UNIX machines, is the user's configuration
file, and controls the user's settings for using SSH.  Placing entries
in the configuration file frees you from having to specify them on the
command line, however it may be more useful to use the command line
for infrequently-used command like port forwarding.</P
><P
>There are many configuration options; to see them all with their
descriptions, look at the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>CONFIGURATION FILES</I
>
section of the man page <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh(1)</B
>.  The more useful
options are summarized below.</P
><P
></P
><DL
><DT
>Host</DT
><DD
><P
>The name of the host (or hosts, since wildcards
'<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*</TT
>' and '<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>?</TT
>'
can be used) which the configuration options following this line apply to.
The <SPAN
CLASS="OPTION"
>host</SPAN
> given on the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> command
line will match against the appropriate <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Host</TT
> line
of the configuration file.</P

><DT
>Compression</DT
><DD
><P
>One of the other nice things about SSH, in addition
to it's security, is that since it replaces <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
>
and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
>, it can do whatever it wants with the data...
in this case, compress it.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Compression</TT
> option
allows the user to specify the level of compression to be used on
connections with the given host.  The possible values are an integer
in the range [1,9], which correspond to the same GNU
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>gzip</SPAN
> values.</P
></DD
><DT
>EscapeChar</DT
><DD
><P
>Specifies the escape character for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>
to use for the connection.  By default this is "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>~</TT
>".
You can also set this to "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>^]</TT
>" to get the normal
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
>|<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
> escape sequence, or
set it to ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>none</TT
>'' to get a session which is "transparent
for binary data" [quote from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ssh(1)</TT
>], meaning you can use
it for transfering with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>kermit</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rz</B
>,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sz</B
>, etc.</P
></DD
><DT
>HostName</DT
><DD
><P
>Specifies the actualy hostname of the machine to
connect to.  This llows you to specify an alias or shortcut for a
host with the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Host</TT
> config option, specify that
alias|shortcut on the command line, and still have it connect to
the correct machine.  In addition, an IP address can be used for
you to give a name to machines-that-have-no-name.</P
></DD
><DT
>KeepAlive</DT
><DD
><P
>Allows control of keepalive messages between the
machines.  Without keepalives, if the network or remote machine
goes down, you won't notice until you try and type a command in,
because the session will simply stay there.  If keepalives are
enabled, SSH will notice if either machine or the network goes down.
However, if the network route is temporarily down the connection
will close, as well.</P
></DD
><DT
>User</DT
><DD
><P
>Specifies the username to use for logging into
this host.  This frees you from having to enter the
"<SPAN
CLASS="OPTION"
>-l username</SPAN
>" option on the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> command line.</P
