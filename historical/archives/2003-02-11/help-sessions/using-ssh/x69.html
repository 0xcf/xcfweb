>The most frequent (and perhaps most important) use; password security
is of upmost importance, especially with the popularity and relative
ease with which brainless morons (i.e., crackers) can sniff data off a
network.  The distributed and cooperative nature of the Internet is
good for service and accessibility, but horrible for security... if
you want security, you must take steps to make it work, and SSH is a
very useful tool to that extent.</P

><DT
>To prevent the capture of information typed (or received)
across the network from the remote host.</DT
><DD
><P
>Not as useful... frankly, most people are just boring.
But if you want to use PGP, SSH (again from the remote machine),
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>passwd</B
> or some other interactive program which
requires you to send or receive sensitive information, SSH will keep
that data secure as it's being sent from|to the remote machine to|from
the local machine over the network.</P
></DD
><DT
>To securely access otherwise insecure services (such as FTP,
HTTP, POP, etc.) on the remote machine.</DT
><DD
><P
>To be fully secure, however, one must look at all the places where
their password is sent out over the network (and is thus available for
capture by a malicious party).  Besides <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
>|
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
> connections, two
other common services which require passwords are FTP and POP.  In
both these cases, the password is sent over the network in clear
text.  However, SSH includes the ability to use these services in an
encrypted manner, thus disallowing the sending of sensitive
information over the network.</P

>SSH is currently being deployed across campus.  SSH is available
on UCB's undergraduate CS machines and socrates.berkeley.edu.  As well,
uclink[234]?.berkeley.edu will be supporting SSH in the near future.
Your local system administrator can be contacted to determine the
availability of (or to encourage the installation of) SSH on other
machines.  An issue of
