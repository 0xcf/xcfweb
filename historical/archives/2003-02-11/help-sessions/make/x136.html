HREF="x136.html#USEFUL-EXAMPLE"

>.</P
><P
>The first is the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

binary named <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

library dependency. The funny syntax,
<TT

><P
>Normally, we would have used the <TT

variable to build a binary using its associated object file.
Unfortunately that only works with absurdly small projects consisting
of but one object file.  Here, we need to find some syntax which
allows us to tell <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> that
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>client</TT
> depends not only on its object files but
also on a library module, which we have represented as a
(non-terminal) dependency.  So we do that on the first line.  Our
dependencies are all set up.</P
><P
>Now comes the tricky part.  We need to somehow write an update
method which will link <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>client</TT
> with the first three
listed dependencies, namely <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>client</TT
>'s object files,
but exclude the last dependency: the library.  (We want to exclude the
library because presumably we have stuck the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-lcommmonlib</TT
> in the <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LDFLAGS</TT
>
variable.  This, among other reasons.)  So we'll use some
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> syntax to get us out of the jam.</P
><P
>Let's pick apart <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$(^:commonlib=)</TT
>.  First,
the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$()</TT
> notation should be familiar.  We're
referencing a variable.  Second, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>^</TT
> is the
variable we are referencing, namely the &quot;all dependencies&quot;
variable.  Finally, we're left with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>:commonlib=</TT
>.
That is a string substitution.  It means, &quot;While expanding this
variable, replace all occurences of the sequence of characters
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>commonlib</TT
> with the empty sequence of
characters.&quot; So we've successfully done away with the library
issue.</P
><P
>As usual, there were other ways to skin this cat.  We could have
used a shell escape and filtered <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>commonlib</TT
> away
with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sed</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>awk</B
>,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>perl</B
>, or your favorite shell tool.  We could have
used a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> subsequence operator... if our version
of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> supports such things.  There are certainly
other ways too.</P
><P
>The second rule I'd like to point out is the funny looking one:
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>libcommonlib.a(textio.o): textio.h</TT
>.  This is
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>THE MOST USEFUL THING YOU CAN LEARN AS A BUILD
ENGINEER</I
>.  I've seen it screwed up in many places, causing
lots of frustration to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
> users.</P
><P
>The parenthetical notation means that inside the archive
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>libcommonlib.a</TT
> is a file
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>textio.o</TT
>.  That archive member depends on
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>textio.h</TT
>.  Therefore, when
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>textio.h</TT
>, the archive member must be updated.</P
><P
>You might think this is pretty uncessary, because we could have
done away with the whole problem using rules similar to the following:

>Actually, that is probably correct.  Not quite as tidy as what
we saw in <A

>Example 2-1</A

to do.  I don't know, I never do it that way.  Usually when I get
lazy, I do it the wrong way, which we'll see in <A

would never be updated, because there is no rule which targets the
