                    <h1>About</h1>

                    <p>XCF, the eXperimental Computing Facility at UC Berkeley, is a small undergraduate
                        student organization with members who share a keen interest in a blend of
                        computer science and engineering.</p>

                    <p>Founded in 1986, XCF started its life as a way to allow a few hackers to
                        develop useful software and offer computing assistance on campus. Throughout
                        its life, XCF had special ties to CS and EECS departments, taking on
                        some of the software development they (and the campus) needed, and providing
                        assistance in those relatively early days of UNIX and Internet.</p>

                    <p>Internally, XCF membership was strongly tied to software development
                        projects, both for on-campus use and for the general public.  XCFers
                        drove each other to become better computer scientists and software engineers
                        through work on these projects. Despite a relatively modest size of the
                        organization, many of the XCF hacks and projects had a significant impact on
                        the computing world as we know it today.</p>

                    <p>Below are some of the XCF stories and projects (WIP).</p>

                    <h2>Formation</h2>

                    <p>For the benefit of the younger generation reading this, allow us to start by
                        painting the picture of computing world in the USA in mid-1980s.
                        Personal computers were making an entrance &mdash; you could pop by a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack">RadioShack</a> for a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000">Tandy 1000</a>;
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80386">80386</a>s were just hitting the
                        streets, but to run a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX">UNIX</a>-like OS,
                        you would need a workstation (easily worth more than a new car, while slower than a
                        smartwatch). The Internet as we know it now did not exist:
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MILNET">MILNET</a> had just broken off
                        from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>, and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSFNET">NSFNET</a> was just coming
                        together.  Home users, though, were limited to
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBSes</a> and the
                        emerging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet">FidoNet</a>.
                        Needless to say, there was no
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWW">World Wide Web</a> yet, and
                        computer-related knowledge was not so easy to come by.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile at UC Berkeley, the access to computing resources for the
                        undergraduates was becoming scarce, and the remaining option was about
                        to be shut down.  This situation prompted a decury of hackers to propose a
                        student-run facility for developing software and offering assistance, and
                        thus the eXperimental Computing Facility was born with an office, a handful of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun</a> workstations, and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Lapsley">Phil Lapsley</a>
                        as the first XCF Director.</p>

                    <p>One of the early XCFer's contributions to the world was
                        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc977">RFC977</a>, the specification for
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nntp">Network News Transfer Protocol</a> (NNTP),
                        which Phil Lapsley co-authored. NNTP remains the workhorse for

                    <p>On the evening of November 2, 1988, a Cornell graduate student
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris">Robert Morris</a>
                        released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm">one of the first worms</a>
                        from a system at MIT. The Internet (at the time estimated at about 60,000 systems)
                        had become massively infected in a matter of hours, with compromised systems becoming
                        entirely overwhelmed and unusable due to a flaw in the worm's design.</p>

                        (the second XCF Director) had already developed mechanisms to detect break-ins, so
                        as they returned to the XCF office after dinner around 7PM PST, it did not take long
                        for the attack to be discovered.
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Systems_Research_Group">CSRG</a>
                        and XCF continued to decompile the worm and work on workarounds and patches through
                        the night. By 8:30PM Peter Yee (another XCFer) posted some details
                        in a message beginning with "We are currently under attack from an Internet VIRUS.
                        It has hit UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, Lawrence Livermore, Stanford, and NASA Ames."

                        began to post details on the patches for sendmail and ways to protect the systems.

                    <pre>Description:

There's a virus running around; the salient facts.  A bug in
sendmail has been used to introduce a virus into a lot of
Internet UNIX systems.  It has not been observed to damage the
host system, however, it's incredibly virulent, attempting to
introduce itself to every system it can find.  It appears to
use rsh, broken passwords, and sendmail to introduce itself
into the target systems.  It affects only VAXen and Suns, as
far as we know.

There are three changes that we believe will immunize your
system.  They are attached.

Thanks to the Experimental Computing Facility, Center for
Disease Control for their assistance.  (It's pretty late,
and they certainly deserved some thanks, somewhere!)</pre>

                    <p>Follow-up messages brought in some corrections and details, including the fingerd patch,
                        and the fourth and final <a href="archives/files/bostic4.txt">message</a> included the patches
                        for the worm itself:</p>

                    <pre>In the Berkeley tradition of fixing other people's software,
and in the general interests of software portability and
matainability, we have provided three fixes for those
individuals wishing to continue to run the worm on their
systems.  To apply theses fixes, discompile the worm
and then use patch.</pre>

                    <p>As World Wide Web was gaining momentum, in 1990
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pei-Yuan_Wei">Pei Wei</a> started working on
                        a new web browser <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViolaWWW">ViolaWWW</a>, to

                    <p>ViolaWWW had introduced a number of features, which were precursors for many
                        commonly-used web technologies of today. Among those were embedded scripting
                        (pre-dating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> in 1995),
                        document insertion
                        (pre-dating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(World_Wide_Web)">FRAME</a>s in 1996),
                        stylesheets
                        (pre-dating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> in 1997/1998).
                        ViolaWWW inspired such technologies as Java Applets and

                    <p>From 1999 until 2012, a sequence of patent lawsuits and appeals had been going on

                        This parallelized collaboration (Spencer mostly on GIMP, Peter mostly on GTK) resulted
                        in public release in 1996, with blessing into the

                    <p>GIMP, now maintained by the The GIMP Development Team, has grown to become the de-facto

                        GIMP continues to evolve and provide a professional feature set to graphics professionals.
                        Reflecting its XCF origin, files saved in GIMP's native format are given
                        the extension <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCF_(file_format)">.xcf</a>.</p>

                        have been de-facto standards of

                        some time, and, while still used today, were becoming a somewhat
                        limiting legacy. In 1996, based on ideas from the XCF faculty adviser
                        <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/hilfinger.html">Paul N. Hilfinger</a>,
                        Josh MacDonald began working on
                        <a href="http://prcs.sourceforge.net/">Project Revision Control System</a> (PRCS), which was
                        one of the early attempts to make a better project-friendly revision control.</p>

                    <p>As an offshoot of PRCS work in 1997, Josh began working on delta compression algorithms, creating
                        <a href="http://xdelta.org/">Xdelta</a> (which he still maintains) and co-authoring
                        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3284">RFC3284</a>, the specification for
                        the VCDIFF Generic Differencing and Compression Data Format, in 2002</p>

                    <h2>Gnutella</h2>
                    <p>In 1995, the specification for a lossy audio coding format
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MPEG-2 Audio Layer III</a>,
                        more commonly referred to as MP3, was published, paving the way
                        for storing music on the hard drives of the time (2 GB HDD was
                        top-of-the-line).
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society">Fraunhofer</a> released
                        a software MP3 encoder
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L3enc">l3enc</a> in July 1994
                        and a software real-time (so long as you had at least a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486DX2">486DX2/66</a>) player
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinPlay3">WinPlay3</a> in September 1995.
                        The shareware version of l3enc limited encoding to 112 kbps, but a hacked
                        version with full 320 kbps support spread around soon enough. Meanwhile, in April 1997,
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft">Nullsoft</a> released
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp">Winamp</a>, which rapidly exceeded
                        3 million downloads. Add to that the emerging of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsl">ADSL</a> and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS">DOCSIS</a> &mdash; a significant
                        step up for home Internet connectivity &mdash; and suddenly a lot of people could
                        encode, transmit, receive, and play nearly-CD-quality MP3s.</p>

                    <p>In June 1999, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a>
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_network">peer-to-peer network</a>
                        became operational, bringing MP3 sharing to a whole new level. At some point various
                        colleges and universities began to block Napster traffic due to sheer bandwidth
                        consumption it caused, particularly from the dorms. But Napster's downfall came
                        not from these blocks, but from the copyright infringement lawsuits and the fact that
                        their service was <i>centralized</i>, and when, eventually, the company could not
                        comply with the District Court's ruling, the service had to be shut down. The first
                        lawsuit in this chain was filed by
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica">Metallica</a> on March 13, 2000.</p>


                    <p>On March 14, 2000, Nullsoft published a client for the first <i>decentralized</i>
                        peer-to-peer network. The client (and, later, the network) was called
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella">Gnutella</a>.
                        The very next day, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL">AOL</a>
                        (which bought Nullsoft nine months earlier) pulled the client off the Nullsoft's
                        servers and stopped any further work on it. But one day was enough.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kan">Gene Kan</a> and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Kimball_(computer_programmer)">Spencer Kimball</a>
                        launched the first Gnutella portal to bring together folks working on reverse-engineering
                        Gnutella protocol and building open-source alternatives to Nullsoft's client, and led
                        the way by releasing a GTK Gnutella client Gnubile &mdash; version 0.20 becoming available
                        on April 13.</p>

                    <p>Gene became a strong advocate for Gnutella and peer-to-peer networking in general,
                        went on to fund
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_search_engine#InfraSearch">InfraSearch, Inc</a>,
                        technology from which later became part of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jxta">JXTA</a>.

                        In July 2000, as Gnutella developer and InfraSearch founder, he

                        at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on "Intellectual Property in the Digital Age", finishing with
                        "We’re on the precipice of a slippery slope. The toothpaste is already out of the tube. It can be exploited nicely, or be turned into a huge mess."
