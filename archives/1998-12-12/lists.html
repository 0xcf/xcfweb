<A NAME="unsubscribing"><H4>A note on unsubscribing</H4></A>
It is normal to experience a several day (up to one week) lag after
unsubscribing from a list.  This is due to the transaction semantics of
our mailing agent: any message which is already in the delivery queue at
the time of your unsubscription bears your address as a destination.
Unfortunately, we cannot modify the queue without jeopardizing its
consistency.  You will notice residual mail especially on high-volume lists
such as Advanced-Java.
