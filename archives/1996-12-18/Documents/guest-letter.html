Jon, 

<p>
In the course of other discussions, I discovered that there are "guest"
accounts on soda for people who are not Berkeley students.  We seem
not to have a specific policy on this, so I have enunciated one, and
this is to inform you (and hence XCF) of it:

<p>
I have no objections to limited guest accounts on [studentadministered 
machines in EECS's jurisdiction], as long as the
appropriate faculty sponsor ... is informed of (and consents to) each
such guest, the guest roster is periodically reviewed, the accounts
cause negligible impact on our facilities, and are not put to
commercial, illegal, or scandalous use.  This notification can be
informal (e.g., a periodic e-mail list of such accounts), and
"consent" can be informal (e.g., ``assume I consent unless you hear
otherwise.'')  

<p>
It is necessary (I believe) that we have an official policy of
monitoring any such account, or I can forsee oodles of trouble if it
turned out that we allowed anyone off the street to get an account
without supervision from the responsible authorities of any kind.
In any case, I certainly expect that there will be very few such accounts.

<p>
P. Hilfinger
