</center>

The <a href="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/">CSUA</A>, The
<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/">OCF</A>, and the
<a href="../../index.html">XCF</A> present
student-run UNIX help seminars on a variety of topics, from introductory
UNIX to advanced topics in system administration and computer security.
You <B>do not</B> need to be a member of the CSUA, OCF, or XCF to attend
these sessions. All help sessions are free and do not require advance
reservation, with the exception of the XCF programming classes, which
will require pre-registration due to the interactive nature of the
classes.

<h1>Debugging Sessions</h1>
</center>
Every Tuesday from 7-9pm XCF members in the office are available for
assistance in debugging fatal errors.  We will focus on fixing
immediate causes of failure, not flaws in conceptual work.
