<title>VI Commands</title>

<pre>
		VI Command list summary:

The following is a comprehensive list of vi commands. The only thing it
might be missing is a few of the less-useful ex commands.

While this list may seem daunting, one must remamber that all you really
need to know are the basic cursor movement commands(hjkl), character delete 
(x), insert (i), exiting insert mode (ESC), and save&exit (ZZ).
All other options are just for speed and convenience.

Sections:

c   left-right and up-down motions   m   options a-n
d   word and text object motions     n   options p-s
e   pattern searches                 o   options t-z
f   various motions; scrolling       p   quickfix and various commands
g   inserting text                   q   command line editing; Ex characters
h   special inserts; changing text   r   Ex ranges
i   complex changes                  s   editing files; using the file list
j   deleting, copying, moving text   t   using tags; writing and quitting
k   repeating commands               u   starting VI
l   key mapping; option commands

A 'N' Before a command means that a numeric argument before it has come
meaning.  For example, 'j' has a 'N' -- so, for example 55j means do 'j'
55 times -- in this case, move 55 lines down.

@ Functions:
	A string of characters may be yanked into a register (see the " command)
	and then executed with the @ command.  I.e.  you delete 'dw' with
