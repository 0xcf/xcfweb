<H1>Prof. Hilfinger's letter on guest account policy in the XCF</H1>

Jon, 

<P CLASS="text">In the course of other discussions, I discovered that
there are "guest" accounts on soda for people who are not Berkeley
students.  We seem not to have a specific policy on this, so I have
enunciated one, and this is to inform you (and hence XCF) of it:</P>

<P CLASS="text">I have no objections to limited guest accounts on
[student administered machines in EECS's jurisdiction], as long as the
appropriate faculty sponsor ... is informed of (and consents to) each
such guest, the guest roster is periodically reviewed, the accounts
cause negligible impact on our facilities, and are not put to
commercial, illegal, or scandalous use.  This notification can be
informal (e.g., a periodic e-mail list of such accounts), and
"consent" can be informal (e.g., ``assume I consent unless you hear
otherwise.'')</P>

<P CLASS="text">It is necessary (I believe) that we have an official
policy of monitoring any such account, or I can forsee oodles of
trouble if it turned out that we allowed anyone off the street to get
an account without supervision from the responsible authorities of any
kind.  In any case, I certainly expect that there will be very few
such accounts.</P>

P. Hilfinger
