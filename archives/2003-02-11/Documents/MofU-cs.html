<TITLE>XCF Memo of Understanding with the CS Department</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<H1>Proposed Memorandum of Understanding between the XCF and the CS Division</H1>

<P CLASS="text">The purpose of this memo is to record the relationship
between UC Berkeley's Experimental Computing Facility (<A
HREF="../../../index.html">XCF</A>) and the UC Berkeley Computer
Science Division (<A HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/">CS</A>).</P>

<P CLASS="text">The XCF is a primarily student organization recognized
by the Computer Science division. The XCF provides computing resources
and an appropriate environment to individuals who undertake
programming (or other computer science related) projects of moderate
size as well as consulting to the users of the CS computing
facilities. In addition, the XCF serves as a contact point between
undergraduates and the CS faculty and staff to coordinate
undergraduate efforts in these projects.</P>

<P CLASS="text">To facilitate general communication and cooperation
between the XCF and CS, the XCF director works with a CS faculty
advisor. The XCF director is an elected member of the organization,
while the advisor is preferably the CNR Committee chair.</P>

<P CLASS="text">While members may join the XCF via the original
proposal process, the XCF extends membership to those who choose to
work on projects for the faculty or staff of the CS division. Faculty
may take advantage of the XCFs participation by mailing project
descriptions to the XCF, who will then make them available on their
information server. The XCF will act as a "clearinghouse" for student
projects, in some cases matching projects with suitably prepared
students. Once a student undertakes a project, the faculty sponsor
reviews the student's progress on a semesterly basis and decides
whether to continue sponsorship. The student may also enroll in the
"Supervised Independent Study" course (CS199). Grades for CS199 should
be based on satisfactory progress on the project.</P>
