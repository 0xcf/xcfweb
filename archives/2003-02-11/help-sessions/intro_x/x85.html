>There are a bunch of windows on your screen; how do you move them,
get rid of them, control them?  That is the role of the window manager.
It puts stuff like borders and title bars on windows, gives you menus,
and all in all make the whole affair prettier. </P
><P
>The standard X11 window manager is <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>twm</B
>.  It is
simple, elegant, small, and relatively fast.  It has a configuration file
called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.twmrc</TT
>, which
is normally located in your home directory.  Here is a list of more
window managers:

as well as being easier to configure than other window managers.</P

>Similar to Afterstep, WindowMaker was made to appear similarly
to the NeXT's UI.  It shares some similar features to Afterstep, but does things
differently at times.</P

><P
>A completely customizable WM, Enlightenment is probably the
best-looking WM in existance.  However, the customizability and prettiness
comes at the price of speed and memory footprint.</P

>The window manager determines to a great extent what your setup will
look like and how it will behave.  I can't get into how to set up your
window manager to do what you want, as only you know what you want,
but a sample config file for <B

>ctwm</B
>, a
