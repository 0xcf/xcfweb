>Now that you have all this stuff you want, you probably don't
want to have to type all those commands everytime you login.  Isn't
there some start up file that will do this all for me like
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.login</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.cshrc</TT
>?
Yup.  The name of this file depends on how you start up X Windows.
The two common ways are with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xdm</B
> and commands
like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xinit</B
> or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>startx</B

the configuration file of note is called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

(well if you are hardcore, you could make it a compiled binary, but
that is just too problematic for most people).  Here is a sample

>Well, actually, on many Sun Solaris machines, the way X windows
is installed and how the engineers wrote some of the scripts that are
run when a person starts up a X windows session, you are forced to have a
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.xsession</TT
> written in <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>/bin/sh</B
> but
you can get around that. You can take a look at an
<A
HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')"

it.</P

>Note that some commands are run in the background and some are
not.  The one that are not, like the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xset</B
> and the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xhost</B
>, are commands that will eventually exit and let the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.xsession</TT
> move on to the next command.  However,
the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xterm</B
>'s are commands that you don't
want to exit immediately &ndash; you want them to hang around a bit.
So you put them in the background with the "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&#38;</TT
>" so
that the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.xsession</TT
> can move
on to the next command.  The last command is called with
"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>exec</TT
>" so that when that command exits (say you
type "exit" in the shell running that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xterm</B
>) the
whole X windows session will exit.  Some people like
to have a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xterm</B
> for a "controlling" process, others
like to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>exec</TT
> a window manager or even a home grown
program that "does what I want".</P

>This way of starting up X Windows works well if there are other
windowing systems installed on the machine besides X or if you'd
prefer not to run X all the time as one would have to with
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xdm</B

is much easier and is more likely to do "what you want".</P

>When starting up X in this manner, you have a configuration
file simiar to the <TT

<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

CLASS="FILENAME"
>.xsession</TT

your <TT

though sometimes users will make a link (with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ln</B

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ln -s</B

in some valid shell language.</P
