>Every instance of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B

to enter the passphrase for their private key.  If multiple
connections are established by the user, this can become annoying.
SSH provides a mechanism to get rid of this annoyance, however,
which offers another advantage at the same time.</P

>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
> program make life simpler
for the heavy SSH user.  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
> runs in the
background, and manages user identities.  The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-add</B
>
program allows the user to add an identity to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
>.
When <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-add</B
> is run, the passphrase for the private key
is asked for.  After that point, whenever <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> is run,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> will communicate with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
>
to get the private key info; the passphrase is not asked for.
In addition, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
> will forward that identity
on to the remote machine; in effect, the identity of the user on the
local machine can be used to connect to other machines from the remote
machine.</P

>However, that use of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B

entails a slight security risk.  Since the passphrase for the user's
identity is not asked for on subsequent ssh connections, anyone can
sit down at the terminal and use SSH to connect to a remote machine.
You'll want to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
> only from a secure
local machine.</P

>In order to allow future instances of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

This means that it must start (or start a parent of) all processes
which want to use it.  There are two reasonable ways to do this:
<P

><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>exec ssh-agent &lt;shell&gt;</B

(such as: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>exec ssh-agent /bin/bash</B
>)</DT
><DD
><P
>This replaces the current shell with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
>,
which will then start another shell for you to interact with.
In effect, the new shell replaces your old one, but
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
> is it's parent. Therefore,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
> is the parent of any
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> session started in this new shell.</P
></DD
><DT
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent startx</B

><DD
><P
>SSH becomes the parent process for
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>startx</B
>, and any instances of
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SSH</B
> started in X become children of
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
>.</P
></DD
></DL
></P
><P
>Then, after the new shell or X comes up, issue the command
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-add</B
> which will add your current identity
(as specified in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.ssh/identity</TT
>) to
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
>.  Future <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>
sessions will then have access to your identity.  With command-line
options, you can also add multiple identities as specified in other
files.</P
><P
>You may ask why adding other identities would be useful.
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
>, however, offers another benefit.
If requested through an option in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.ssh/config</TT
>, all
identities which the local <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
> knows about will be
forwarded to other machines.  If you add these identities at the local
machine (and therefore enter their passphrases on the local machine),
they will be automagically propagated to all machines you are
connected to through SSH.</P
