>The data in this section assumes that the CGI program is
running in a multiuser environment with strict permission-based access
privledges between users; specifically, this section assumes knowledge
of Unix and Unix file permissions.  This information probably will not
pertain to single-user web servers such as Windows95 or
WindowsNT.</P

>The web server runs under a specific identity, which limits and
controls which files the web server has access to.  This is a good
thing for many security reasons, but it can also be a nuisance at
times.  Many are accustomed to making their HTML files world-readable,
which allows the web server process [which runs under a different
user-id from the user who create the HTML files] to access the files
and serve them up to the user accessing their page.  The same must be
done for CGI scripts.  Since the scripts must be executed by the web
server, they must analogously be world-executable.  There may be other
restrictions on CGI programs [for example: that they must end with
"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.cgi</TT
>"]; see your web server's documentation for
details.</P
><P
>Another important note regarding user identities as they relate
to CGI programs is the fact that programs run as the user which
started the process.  So, a CGI program which is started by the web
server will run with the identity of the web server, not with the
identity of the user who created it.  This is especially important for
write-access to files.  If a CGI program, written by the user "luser",
relies on a file "cgidata" which luser has in her HTML-file directory,
when it is run by the web server [with user-identity "www"], it will
not have access to the "cgidata" file, unless luser made the file
world-readable.  If the CGI program is to write to the file, things
get even worse.  luser would not want to make the file
world-writeable, since any other user on the machine could write to
the file, which is a Bad Thing.  But since the CGI program runs as www
and not as luser, that is the only way to write to the file.  Since
most CGI application will want to write to files, there is a
problem.</P
><P
>Fortunately, there exists a better solution.  Unix has a special
permission for programs called "setuid".  This means that when the
program is run, it runs with the identity of the user who owns the
file, not the identity of the user executing the program.  Thus, when
the web server [user "www"] executes luser's program, it runs with
luser's permissions.  luser can then make the file user-write-able,
and the program would have the ability to write to it, but other users
would not.  Use of the setuid bit is somewhat dangerous since it
allows access to otherwise private files, but with care can be used to
great advantage.</P

>As noted, this information is Unix-specific.  However, the
concept applies to any multiuser operating system with user-based file
permissions.  In a single-user operating environment, the web server
and the user who created the CGI script are equivalent, and thus the
above discussion is irrelevant.</P
