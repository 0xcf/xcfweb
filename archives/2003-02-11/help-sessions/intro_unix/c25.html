>Well, what can you do with a Unix account?  Just about anything you
want.  You can read and send mail and news from it, program, do online
research, and a whole bunch of other things.  You can use it for
"serious" work or for fun.  Serious work might include writing code in
C or C++, researching the history of art, or writing up a technical
paper; fun might include writing code in C or C++, playing games,
reading news, or trying to figure out <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>how</I

up that technical paper. </P

means that are variations on these, but these are the important ones.</P

and Windows 95; it is included with the system software on all platforms.  The
<B

there are now versions available for non-Unix machines.  Here is how
one might use the <B

<B

this can be done with a file called <B

login in from soda.CSUA.Berkeley.EDU without a password, and similarly for
the next two lines.  If you omit the second part of each line, then 
one may login to the this  account only if one has the same login,
that is helper@scam.xcf.berkeley.edu, in the case of the last line.</P

>After you login, the system will print out the contents of the file

You should take the time to read this file as it will often contain important
information.  Then, the system will give you a prompt to tell you it
is ready for your commands.

>Well, now what?  You have logged in.  That means that somehow, you
have shown to some degree of certainty that you are the person
associated with a certain account name.  After the system is convinced
of this, it will put you, figuratively, in a directory known as your
home directory.  This is where most of your personal files are stored
and it usually has a name like
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home/d/users/jonboy</TT
> or
something like that.  Your home directory is like your own personal
filing cabinet.  You can place files in it, have folders (called
directories in Unix parlance) with more files and even directories
in those as well.</P
