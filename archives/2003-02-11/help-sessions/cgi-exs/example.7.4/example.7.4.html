<H2>Example 7.4 | CGI-based image selection</H2>

<BR CLEAR=all>
<HR>

This is an example of an image which has been selected and returned by
a CGI program.

<P>

When this HTML file is loaded, the web browser will then re-connect to
the web server to get any files [graphics, etc] which are mentioned in
the HTML data.  In this case, specifically, the browser will reconnect
to the server to get the image file "example.7.4.cgi"... which the web
server will recognize as a CGI file and execute.
<P>
Our example.7.4.cgi script will then return the correct
<TT>Content-Type</TT>, in this case <TT>image/gif</TT>, and return the
data, which will be displayed in it's correct location.
<P>
Since the CGI script which output this image will always output the
same image, this is useful for demonstration purposes only.  But the
principle is very useful, as data can be passed following a '?' in the
&lt;IMG SRC="cgiprog.cgi?&lt;extra data&gt;" ....&gt; line, which
allows one to specify whatever one wants to make the script more
useful.
<P>
An example of this is randomized image selection; the CGI program can
be passed the name of a directory from which to randomly choose an
image, and will do so.  See 
<A HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">
getinfo.cgi</A> 
for an example of this.  As well, a product ID number could be passed,
which would allow the CGI script to get the correct graphic from a
database or other source associated with the product ID.

<P>

<TT>example.7.4.cgi</TT> source</A><BR>

<TT>print-source.cgi</TT> source</A>
