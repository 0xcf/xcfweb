What can you do on the Internet?
   o E-mail
   o Usenet
   o Information Retrieval (ftp, gopher, www)
   o Lots of other resources (mailing lists, games, etc...)

How do you get on the Internet at Berkeley?
   o Open Computing Facility (OCF), located in the WEB
     Access to just about anything you can find on
     the Internet, open to anybody affiliated with
     the University -- students, staff, faculty.

   o UcLink, 241 Evans
     Limited to e-mail, ftp, and gopher.  Also open
     to UCB students, staff, and faculty.

   o Computer Science Undergraduate Association (CSUA) 343 Soda Hall
     Similar access as the OCF, but intended for
     students with an interest in Computer Science.

   o Various departments and classes provide Internet
     access for course work or research projects.

Logging in
   o Telnet and rlogin
     A program that lets you connect from one machine to
     another.  For example, once you have reached a prompt
     from which the telnet or rlogin command is available,
     you can use the command "telnet uclink" or
     "rlogin monsoon" to connect to another machine.
     You can also use telnet and rlogin to connect from one
     account to another.

   o Logging in from the Microcomputer Facilities, Residence
     Hall Academic Centers, or any personal computer with a
     direct network connection

     Most machines with network connections on campus have
     telnet software installed.  Consult a staff member or
     attendant if you have questions about how to use it.

   o Logging in from home
     The following telephone numbers are available for
     dialing in with a modem:

	643-9600	9600/14.4K baud Port Selector
	642-6092	2400 baud Port Selector
	642-5131	9600/14.4K baud Annex for EECS machines
	642-6679	2400 baud Annex

     If you call a number that attaches to a "Port Selector"
     then you will get a prompt that looks like "Request: ",
     at which point, you should type "annex", press return,
     and then press return again when you get a message that
     says "Connecting"

     Once you have connected to the annex (either by dialing
     directly in to the annex or by requesting it from the
     port selector), the telnet and rlogin commands are available.

   o Logging in from a terminal
     There are several places on campus where dumb terminals
     are available, including the WEB (Workstations in Evans
     Basement) and various libraries.  These give you access
     to the port selector described above in the "Logging in
     from home" section.

Once you've connected
   o Logging in
     You will be prompted for your account name and your
     password.  Once you type them in, you will be logged
     in.

   o Setting your terminal type
     Since you can log in to most Unix systems from many
     different types of terminals, the computer you are logging
     in to needs to know what sort of terminal you are on so
     it knows how to talk to it.

     Before you can tell the computer you are logging in to
     (the remote computer) what terminal type you are using,
     you need to know what it is.  Most terminal software
     (such as the telnet programs on Macs and PCs) emulate a
     terminal called a "vt100".  Vt100 is a very common
     terminal type, so it is a good guess if you're not sure
     what your terminal type is.

     Once you have figured out what your terminal type is,
     some computers are configured to ask you when you log in
     what terminal type you are using.  If the computer you
     are using is configured this way, you should be able to
     simply type it in and not worry about it.

     On computers that are not configure this way, if you have
     problems you need to issue the following sequence of
     commands:

	unsetenv TERMCAP
	setenv TERM vt100		(For example)
	eval `tset -s`

     You will find computers to be quite unforgiving if you
     make typos, so it is important that you type these commands
     exactly as they appear above.

   o Once you are logged in
     After you finish with the above steps, you will be logged
     in to the remote computer.  A series of messages are often
     printed, known as the messaged of the day (motd for short).
     These messages are put their by system administrators to
     make important announcements.

     Eventually, you should get a prompt from which you can issue
     commands.  A common prompt is simply a percent sign (%).
     Fancier prompts may include the name of the computer you are
     logged in to or the number of commands you have executed.
     This prompt is called the "shell prompt" and you should
     remember what it looks like -- it is the only prompt from
     which you can issue most commands.

Now what?
   o Your password
     Your password protects your account from unauthorized use
     from anybody besides you.  You should not let anybody else
     know what your password is.  Not even system administrators
     need to know your password.

     Passwords are stored in a secure form so that they cannot
     be decoded, but they can be systematically guessed.  An
     intruder with a powerful computer available could easily
     take a whole dictionary and see if any of the words in the
     dictionary match your password.
     Use the following guidlines in choosing a password:
		Do not use a name, or word in any language.
		Do not use something commonly knowledgeable about you.
		Use multiple words, punctuation, numbers, symbols, etc.
		Remember, UNIX is case-sensitive: MyPass is very different
			from mYpA$s
		Try to make up something that you can remember, or at least
			figure out again.

     You should also change your password on a regular basis.
     The command to change your password is "passwd".  It
     should ask for your old password as confirmation, and
     then have you type your new password.

   o Getting Help
     Unix and the Internet are very broad topics and we don't
     have enough time to tell you about all but a small
     fraction of what's available.  Fortunately, many resources
     are available to help you learn about Unix and the 'net.

     The "man" command allows you to read the manual pages
     for Unix commands.  The syntax is "man <command>".  For
     example, to find out about the passwd command, you
     would do "man passwd".

     The man command also allows you to look up keywords and
     find commands available that match your keyword.  For
     example, to find out about all the commands that relate
     to passwords, issue the command "man -k password"

     The -k in the above example is what is known as a
     command line switch.  Many Unix commands can be modified
     by one or more of these switches, which nearly always
     have the form of a dash followed by a letter.

     If you still need more help, consult the staff that runs
     the computer you are using.  You may have heard that you
     should send mail to root to get questions answered.
     However, many systems have special mail addresses set up
     for consulting.  A few of them are:

	staff@ocf	For general UNIX questions
	help@csua	For general UNIX questions
	help@xcf	For general UNIX questions
	consult@uclink	For questions about Uclink


A few basic Unix commands
   o Listing files
     When you log in, you will be placed in your "home directory".
     This is just like a directory on a DOS machine or like a
     folder on a Macintosh.  You can store personal files in
     your home directory, but probably have a quota on how much
     space you can use.

     An aside on directories: a disk can be thought of as a file
     drawer; to keep things seperate you have things in different
     folders, called "directories".  Directories can themselves
     contain directories, as well as normal files.  Each user on a
     system has a "home directory", which is a directory owned by you
     where you store your files.

     There are two special directory names: "." refers to the current
     directory, and ".." to the one above.

     You can use "mkdir" and "rmdir" to create and remove directories.

     To see the files in the current directory (which is your
     home directory when you first log in), use the command "ls".
     The ls command also supports several command line options.

	ls -a will list all the file in the current directory
              including "dot files".
	ls -l will show a full line with extra information
              about all files.
	ls -F will show file types by appending a / to
              directories, and a * to executables.

   o Viewing the contents of a file
     The simplest command to display the contents of a file
     is "cat".  It will simply take the contents of the file
     you name and print it all out.

     The commands "more" and "less" are a little more friendly;
     they will print the given file a page at a time, pausing
     at the end of every page and wait for you to press the
     space bar to go on.

     The "head" and "tail" commands allow you to look at just
     the beginning or just the end of a file.  By default,
     they display 10 lines, although you can give it a different
     number of lines prepended with a dash.  For example,
     "head -25 foo" would print the first 25 lines of the file
     named foo.

     Beware however, some files cannot be displayed with these
     commands.  Some programs store data in formats that do not
     look like regular text, and you will not be able to make
     sense out of the file.  If you have a file that doesn't
     make sense, you may be able to get some information with
     the "file" command.  For example, "file foo" will tell
     you what sort of file foo is, if it can be determined.

   o Deleting files
     If you have files around that you don't need any more,
     you should delete them to conserve disk space and remain
     under your quota.  The command "rm" allows you to delete
     a file.  For example, "rm foo" removes the file named foo.
     The rm command is often set up to confirm that you want
     to delete files before they are actually deleted.

   o Renaming and copying files
     The command to rename a file is "mv".  For example, the
     command "mv foo bar" renames the file foo to bar.  Files
     can also be copied with the "cp" command.

   o Privacy
     The command "mesg" lets you control whether or not people
     can talk to you and send you messages while you are logged
     on.  "mesg y" allows messages, "mesg n" denies messages,
     and "mesg" by itself tells you the current setting.

     You can send messages to other users logged in to the same
     computer that you are using (if they are allowing messages)
     with the command "write user".  For instance, if you were
     logged in to the same computer as shyguy, the command
     "write shyguy" would send him a message.  Everything you
     type would appear on his screen until you type control-D.

     The "talk" program is similar, but much more powerful.  In
     order to talk to another user, you need to know their login
     name and the computer they are logged in to.  This may look
     similar to their e-mail address, and we'll talk more about
     it shortly.

     To use the talk program, the comand is simply
     "talk user@machine".  For example, "talk shyguy@uclink".
     The talk program will bring up a window in which you can
     see what you are typing and what the person you are talking
     to is typing.  One caveat:  the talk program is not very
     standardized, so many different computers run incompatible
     versions of the talk software.  The easiest way to remedy
     this is to use the "ytalk" program if it is available.

How to refer to other users on the Internet
   o Computer Names
     With thousands if not millions of computers connected to the
     Internet, a simple scheme is needed to uniquely identify
     individual machines on the net.  The scheme that is used is
     known as the Domain Naming System.

     Computer names are organized in a hierarchical fashion,
     according to where the computer is connected to the Internet.
     These names consists of a series of words separated by periods.
     As you read a name from right to left, it becomes more and more
     specific.

     For example, Uclink's name on the Internet is uclink.berkeley.edu.
     The rightmosts part of the address is edu.  This means that
     uclink is somehow part of the EDUcational domain.  All machines
     ending with .edu belong to colleges, universities, and other
     educational institutions in the United States.

     The next component of the name is berkeley.  This means that
     with in the educational domain, this computer is located at
     the University of California at Berkeley.  The names of all
     computers around the campus will end in .berkeley.edu.  Finally,
     the name of the computer is uclink.

     There can be an arbitrary number of pieces of the name
     separated by period, although most names don't have more than 4.

   o Top Level Domains
     The rightmost part of a computer name is called the top level
     domain.  We have already seen the .edu domain, and there are
     several other common ones:

	.com	- COMmercial sites
	.mil	- MILitary sites
	.gov	- GOVernment sites
	.org	- ORGanizations
	.net	- NETwork administration sites

     In addition, sites outside the United States have a code for
     the country in which they are located as the top level domain:

	.jp	- JaPan
	.uk	- United Kingdom
	.au	- AUstralia

   o E-mail addresses
     An e-mail address has the form "user@machine.domain".  The
     easiest way to find out what somebody's e-mail address is
     is to get it directly for them.  If you need help locating
     somebody, look at the help documentation on the OCF gopher
     server or mail staff@ocf.

   o Simplifying e-mail addresses
     You can also leave off parts of e-mail addresses, in which
     case they are implicity the same as the computer you are
     using.  For example, if you are logged in to uclink, the
     name "minmai" refers implicitly to "minmai@uclink.berkeley.edu"
     If you were using the OCF, the e-mail address "aswan@cs"
     would implicity refer to "aswan@cs.berkeley.edu".

   o Locating people
     Many programs (such as talk, finger, etc...) require you to
     specify another person on the Internet.  For these programs,
     you use something that looks very much like an e-mail address
     but is slightly differnet.

     The reason for this is that many names on the Internet are
     set up to receive e-mail but the name of the computer in an
     e-mail address does not necessarily correspond to the computer
     that its users log in to.

     For example, users of the OCF have e-mail addresses of the
     form "user@ocf.berkeley.edu", although users of the OCF log
     in to different machines (bigbang, monsoon, etc...)

     For programs like "talk", it is important that you specify
     the name of the computer the person you are trying to contact
     is actually using, and not the name in their e-mail address.

   o Finding out about other people on the Internet
     The command "finger" gives you information about another user
     on the Internet.  For example "finger shyguy@ocf" will tell
     you a bunch of information about that account.

E-mail
   o Reading mail
     If you have e-mail waiting, simply type "mail" to read it.
     You will get a list of your waiting messages.  You can type
     simply the message number to read a message, and then type
     "d" after reading it to delete it.

     You can quit the mail program with either "q" or "x".  If
     you use "q", all the changes you made will be saved.  That
     is, messages that you deleted will be gone.  On the other
     hand, if you use "x", then no changes will be made and
     your mail will be in the exact same state it was in when
     you started the mail program.

   o Sending mail
     To send e-mail to somebody else, the command is "mail address".
     For example, "mail aswan@cs.berkeley.edu".  You will be
     prompted for a Subject and can then begin typing the message.
     To finish the message, type a period on a line by itself.

   o More advanced mail features
     Doing anything more complicated with the mail program is
     very difficult.  A better choice is to use a mail program
     such as "elm" or "pine".  Both programs are designed to be
     more powerful and yet much easier to use.

Other cool things
   o There are many more things that you can do with access to
     the Internet, but we don't have time to cover them all
     here.  Future help sessions will cover these topics. Here
     are a few things to try if you can't wait:

   o trn
     Reading Usenet news

   o gopher
     Getting information about all sorts of things...

   o lynx or Mosaic (Mosaic only works on graphical terminals
     running X-Windows)

     A more advanced form of information retrieval.
