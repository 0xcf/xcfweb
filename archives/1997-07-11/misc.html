<h3>Unsavory Hacks</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">The clue server</a>, Yarsolav's first XCF
        hack. Somewhat disconcerting,
	but a clever sattire of the <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu">MIT
	postcard server</a>. Hardly worth using. It's probably not even
	ready for release. He spent 3 hours on it.

<li><A TARGET="_parent" HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">The DeAd system</a> allows one to use various search engines and sites <b>without seeing the annoying banner adversiments</b>.  DeAd is the definition of an unsavory hack.  Yaroslav spent one afternoon and half a night on it so far.
<li><A TARGET="_parent" HREF="javascript:alert('link disabled in archive')">The XCF Suck Pages</a>, brought to you by the XCF Suck
			Consortium, and generated automatically by macros.
</li>
